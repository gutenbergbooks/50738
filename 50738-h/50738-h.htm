<span class="subhead">OLD GENEVA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Towns which expand too fast and become too
prosperous tend to lose their individuality. Geneva
has enjoyed that fortune, and has paid that price
for it.</p>

<p>Straddling the Rhone, where it issues from the
bluest lake in the world, looking out upon green
meadows and wooded hills, backed by the dark
ridge of the Salève, with the ‘great white mountain’
visible in the distance, it has the advantage of an
incomparable site; and it is, from a town surveyor’s
point of view, well built. It has wide
thoroughfares, quays, and bridges; gorgeous public
monuments and well-kept public gardens; handsome
theatres and museums; long rows of palatial
hotels; flourishing suburbs; two railway-stations,
and a casino. But all this is merely the façade&mdash;all
of it quite modern; hardly any of it more than
half a century old. The real historical Geneva&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>the
little of it that remains&mdash;is hidden away in the
background, where not every tourist troubles to
look for it.</p>

<p>It is disappearing fast. Italian stonemasons are
constantly engaged in driving lines through it.
They have rebuilt, for instance, the old Corraterie,
which is now the Regent Street of Geneva, famous
for its confectioners’ and booksellers’ shops; they
have destroyed, and are still destroying, other
ancient slums, setting up white buildings of
uniform ugliness in place of the picturesque but
insanitary dwellings of the past. It is, no doubt,
a very necessary reform, though one may think
that it is being executed in too utilitarian a spirit.
The old Geneva was malodorous, and its death-rate
was high. They had more than one Great
Plague there, and their Great Fires have always
left some of the worst of their slums untouched.
These could not be allowed to stand in an age
which studies the science and practises the art of
hygiene. Yet the traveller who wants to know
what the old Geneva was really like must spend a
morning or two rambling among them before they
are pulled down.</p>

<p>The old Geneva, like Jerusalem, was set upon a
hill, and it is towards the top of the hill that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
few buildings of historical interest are to be found.
There is the cathedral&mdash;a striking object from a
distance, though the interior is hideously bare.
There is the Town Hall, in which, for the convenience
of notables carried in litters, the upper
stories were reached by an inclined plane instead of
a staircase. There is Calvin’s old Academy, bearing
more than a slight resemblance to certain of the
smaller colleges at Oxford and Cambridge. There,
too, are to be seen a few mural tablets, indicating
the residences of past celebrities. In such a house
Rousseau was born; in such another house&mdash;or in
an older house, now demolished, on the same site&mdash;Calvin
died. And towards these central points the
steep and narrow, mean streets&mdash;in many cases
streets of stairs&mdash;converge.</p>

<p>As one plunges into these streets one seems
to pass back from the twentieth century to the
fifteenth, and need not exercise one’s imagination
very severely in order to picture the town as it
appeared in the old days before the Reformation.
The present writer may claim permission to borrow
his own description from the pages of ‘Lake
Geneva and its Literary Landmarks’:</p>

<p>‘Narrow streets predominated, though there were
also a certain number of open spaces&mdash;notably at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
markets, and in front of the Cathedral, where there
was a traffic in those relics and rosaries which
Geneva was presently to repudiate with virtuous
indignation. One can form an idea of the appearance
of the narrow streets by imagining the oldest
houses that one has seen in Switzerland all closely
packed together&mdash;houses at the most three stories
high, with gabled roofs, ground-floors a step or two
below the level of the roadway, and huge arched
doors studded with great iron nails, and looking
strong enough to resist a battering-ram. Above
the doors, in the case of the better houses, were
the painted escutcheons of the residents, and crests
were also often blazoned on the window-panes.
The shops, too, and more especially the inns,
flaunted gaudy sign-boards with ingenious devices.
The Good Vinegar, the Hot Knife, the Crowned
Ox, were the names of some of these; their tariff
is said to have been fivepence a day for man and
beast.</p>

<p>‘The streets, being narrow, were also very
generally crowded, and were particularly crowded
in the evenings. From the stuffy houses&mdash;and
even in these days of sanitation a really old Swiss
house is sometimes stuffy enough to make the
stranger gasp for breath&mdash;the citizens of high as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
well as low degree sallied to take their pleasure in
the street. The street was their drawing-room.
They stood and gossiped there; they sat about
on benches underneath their windows. Or some
musician would strike up a lively tune, and ladies
of the highest position in society&mdash;the daughters
and wives of Councillors and Syndics&mdash;attired in
velvets and silks and satins, would dance round-dances
in the open air. For all their political
anxieties, these early Genevans were, on the whole,
a merry people.</p>

<p>‘But&mdash;let there be no mistake about it&mdash;they
made merry in the midst of filth and evil smells.
On this point we have unimpeachable information
in the shape of a rescript issued by the Chapter of
the Cathedral after conference with the Vidomne
and the Syndics. The Chapter complains that too
many citizens dispose of their slops by carelessly
throwing them out of window, and establish refuse-heaps
outside their front-doors&mdash;a noisome practice
which still prevails in many of the Swiss villages,
though no longer in any of the Swiss towns. It is
also complained that nearly every man has a pig-sty,
and lets his pigs run loose in the streets for
exercise, and that there is an undue prevalence of
such unsavoury industries as the melting of tallow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and the burning of the horns of cattle. One can
imagine the net result of this great combination of
nuisances. In a city of magnificent distances it
might have passed. Bayswater, at the present day,
lives in ignorance of the smells of Bermondsey.
But in Geneva, when Geneva was almost as small
as Sandwich, one can understand that the consequences
were appalling to the nostrils of the polite.
The fact that the city was so overrun with lepers
and beggars that two lazar-houses and seven
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hôpitaux</i>&mdash;or casual wards, as one might say&mdash;had
to be provided for their reception, adds something,
though not perhaps very much, to this unpleasant
side of the picture.</p>

  <div class="caption">L’ÉGLISE DE LA MADELEINE, GENEVA</div></div>

<p>‘Our ecclesiastical rescript further proves that
while the Genevans were a merry and a dirty, they
were also an immoral, people. It records that they
are unduly addicted to the game of dice, and that
the outcome of this pastime is “fraud, deception,
theft, rapine, lies, fights, brawls, and insults, to say
nothing of damnable blasphemy”; and it ordains
that any man who “swears without necessity” shall
“take off his hat and kneel down in the place of
his offence, and clasp his hands, and kiss the earth”&mdash;or
pay a fine of three halfpence if he fail to do so.
Then it proceeds to propound an elaborate scheme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
for the State regulation of immorality, forbidding
certain indulgences “to clergymen as well as
laymen”; and requiring the Social Evil to wear
something in the nature of a Scarlet Letter to
distinguish her from other women.’</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the first half of the sixteenth century occurred
the two events which shaped the future of Geneva:
Reformation theology was accepted; political
independence was achieved.</p>

<p>Geneva, it should be explained, was a fief of the
duchy of Savoy; or so, at all events, the Dukes
of Savoy maintained, though the citizens were of
the contrary opinion. Their view was that they
owed allegiance only to their Bishops, who were
the Viceroys of the Holy Roman Emperor; and
even that allegiance was limited by the terms of a
Charter granted in the Holy Roman Emperor’s
name by Bishop Adhémar de Fabri. All went
fairly well until the Bishops began to play into the
hands of the Dukes; but then there was friction,
which rapidly became acute. A revolutionary
party&mdash;the Eidgenossen, or Confederates&mdash;was
formed. There was a Declaration of Independence
and a civil war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
So long as the Genevans stood alone, the Duke
was too strong for them. He marched into the
town in the style of a conqueror, and wreaked his
vengeance on as many of his enemies as he could
catch. He cut off the head of Philibert Berthelier,
to whom there stands a memorial on the island in the
Rhone; he caused Jean Pecolat to be hung up in
an absurd posture in his banqueting-hall, in order
that he might mock at his discomfort while he
dined; he executed, with or without preliminary
torture, several less conspicuous patriots. Happily,
however, some of the patriots&mdash;notably Besançon
Hugues&mdash;got safely away, and succeeded in concluding
treaties of alliance between Geneva and
the cantons of Berne and Fribourg. The men of
Fribourg marched to Geneva, and the Duke
retired. The citizens passed a resolution that he
should never be allowed to enter the town again,
seeing that he ‘never came there without playing
the citizens some dirty trick or other’; and, the
more effectually to prevent him from coming, they
pulled down their suburbs and repaired their
ramparts, one member of every household being
required to lend a hand for the purpose.</p>

<div id="ip_10" class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
  <img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="453" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE LAST SNOW ON THE WOODED SLOPES</div></div>

<p>Presently, owing to religious dissensions, Fribourg
withdrew from the alliance. Berne, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
adhered to it, and, in due course, responded to the
appeal for help by setting an army of seven thousand
men in motion. The route of the seven thousand
lay through the canton of Vaud, then a portion of
the Duke’s dominions, governed from the Castle
of Chillon. Meeting with no resistance save at
Yverdon, they annexed the territory, placing
governors (or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">baillis</i>) of their own in its various
strongholds. The Governor of Chillon fled, leaving
his garrison to surrender; and in its deepest
dungeon was found the famous prisoner of Chillon,
François de Bonivard. From that time forward
Geneva was a free republic, owing allegiance to no
higher power.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE REFORMATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Reformation occurred simultaneously with the
political revolution; and the informal historian, who
is under no compulsion to take a side, is inevitably
impressed less by the piety of the Reformers than
by their uproarious behaviour. Their leader&mdash;the
ringleader in their disturbances&mdash;was Farel, a hot-headed
Frenchman from Gap, in Dauphiné. He
hounded the people on to wreck the churches;
he invaded the pulpits of other preachers without
invitation, and confuted them therefrom; he once
broke up an ecclesiastical procession, and, snatching
an image out of the priest’s hand, threw it over the
bridge into the river. Moreover, as was natural,
he included among his devoted followers many
evangelists whose zeal was, like his own, conspicuously
in excess of their discretion. Of one of
them, Pastor Malingre of Yverdon, it is recorded
by a contemporary chronicler that ‘his methods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
were not very evangelical&mdash;he used to crown the
Roman Catholic priests with cow-dung.’</p>

<p>Reform was already in the air when Farel came
to Geneva to preach. The new doctrine had been
bruited abroad by pedlars from Nuremberg, who
ate meat on Fridays, and expressed the opinion
that ‘the members of the religious Orders ought to
be set to work in the fields, that the saints were
dead and done for, and that it was nonsense to pray
to them, seeing that they could render no assistance.’
So we read in Bonivard’s ‘Chronicle’; but, even so,
Geneva was not quite prepared to receive Farel
with open arms. He was haled before an ecclesiastical
court, and accused of preaching the Gospel
in an inappropriate costume&mdash;‘got up like a
gendarme or a brigand.’ One burly monk gave
him a ‘coup de pied, quelque part,’ and the monks
collectively proposed to throw him into the Rhone;
and, though the laity protected him from clerical
violence, the Syndic ordered him to quit the town
within six hours, as an alternative to being burnt
alive. He went, and three years passed before he
returned and triumphed in a theological disputation
held in the great hall of the Couvent de la Rive.</p>

<p>The result of that disputation was, as has been
written, that ‘religious liberty was taken away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
from the Roman Catholics and given to the
Protestants.’ The celebration of the Mass, so
recently a solemn duty, now became a high crime
and misdemeanour; and the victorious Reformers
proceeded, like the French anti-clericals of our
own day, to the expulsion of monks and nuns.
The first to go were the Sisters of the Convent of
Sainte-Claire, founded in 1476 by Yolande, wife
of Duke Amadeus IX. of Savoy and sister of
Louis XI. of France. We have a full account
of their ejection from the pen of one of them,
Sister Jeanne de Jussie, afterwards Lady Superior
of a convent at Annecy.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE EXPULSIONS OF THE NUNS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Sisters had long been exposed to annoyance
by Reformers of the baser sort. One such
Reformer, having occasion to call at the convent
on some municipal business, had insisted on
washing his hands in the holy water, and had boasted,
when he got outside, that he had been privileged
to kiss the nuns all round&mdash;‘a foul lie,’ says Sister
Jeanne, ‘for he did not even attempt to kiss any
one of us.’ Another Reformer had preached
against them, declaring that they ought to be
‘turned out and compelled to marry in accordance
with the commandment of God’; and the congregation
had been so impressed by the discourse
that the younger men among the worshippers had
climbed up on to the convent wall, and sat there
singing amorous songs for the edification of the
inmates.</p>

<p>No official action was taken, however, until after
the conclusion of the disputation above referred to,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
though then it followed quickly. Fifteen Reformers,
including Farel and Viret, called at the convent,
declined the invitation to say what they had to say
through the grating, but threatened to force the
door if they were not admitted. The door was
opened to them, therefore, and all the Sisters being
summoned before them in the chapter-house,
Farel ‘spoke in terms of vituperation of the holy
cloister, of religion, of chastity, and of virginity, in
a way that went to the hearts of the poor Sisters.’
The others kept silence, but Mère Vicaire protested,
interrupted, and screamed. Our narrative proceeds:</p>

<p>‘She stationed herself between the Sisters and
the young men, saying:</p>

<p>‘“Since your preacher is such a holy man, why
don’t you treat him with respect and obedience?
You’re a pack of young rascals, but you won’t
make any progress here.”</p>

<p>‘Whereat they were all indignant, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘“What the devil is the matter with the woman?
Are you mad? Go back to your place.”</p>

<p>‘“I won’t,” she said, “until these young men
leave the Sisters alone!”’</p>

<p>So Mère Vicaire was put out of the room; and
the preacher resumed his discourse on the institution
of matrimony. We read that ‘when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
referred to the corruption of the flesh, the Sisters
began to scream’; and that when he spoke of the
advantages of married life, the Mère Vicaire, who
was listening at the key-hole, began to batter at
the panels, exclaiming: ‘Don’t you listen to him,
my sisters; don’t you listen to him.’ So, after
labouring at the conversion of the Sisters from ten
o’clock in the morning until five o’clock in the
afternoon, the Reformers retired discomfited. A
crowd of three hundred persons was waiting for
them outside the gate, prepared to offer marriage
to any nun whom they might have persuaded to
accompany them; but they came forth alone, the
last to leave being thumped on the back by a nun
who desired to hurry his departure.</p>

<p>It transpired, however, that one of the Sisters&mdash;‘the
ill-advised Sister Blasine’&mdash;had been converted
by the Reformers’ arguments. The other nuns
tried to detain her, but the citizens broke into the
convent and fetched her out in triumph, and also
insisted that the convent should provide her with
a dowry and pay her damages for the disciplinary
whippings inflicted upon her during her membership
of the Order. It was the culminating outrage.
The nuns decided to leave Geneva, and the Lady
Superior applied to the Syndic for an armed escort.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
The request was granted, and the ‘dolorous
departure’ began. Three hundred soldiers were
turned out to see the Sisters safely across the bridge
over the Arve, where the territory of Geneva
ended. It was the first time since their taking of
the veil that they had been outside the convent
walls, and some of them had spent all their lives in
the cloister and grown old there, so that they were
in no fit state to travel thus on foot. Let Sister
Jeanne tell us what befell them:</p>

<div id="ip_20" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="600" height="437" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">GENEVA FROM THE ARVE</div></div>

<p>‘Truly it was a pitiful thing to see this holy
company in such condition, so overcome by pain
and toil that several of them broke down and
fainted by the way&mdash;and that on a rainy day and
in a muddy road, and with no means of getting out
of their trouble, for they were all on foot, except
four invalids who were in a cart. There were six
poor aged Sisters, who had been for sixteen years
members of the Order, and two who for sixty-six
years had never been outside the convent gate.
The fresh air was too much for them. They
fainted away; and when they saw the beasts of
the fields, they were terrified, thinking that the
cows were bears, and that the sheep were ravening
wolves. Those who met them could not find
words to express their compassion for them; and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
though the Mère Vicaire had given each Sister a
stout pair of boots to keep her feet dry, the greater
number of them would not walk in boots, but
carried them tied to their girdles, and in this way it
took them from five o’clock in the morning until
nearly nightfall to reach Saint Julien, though the
distance is less than a league.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="subhead">THE RULE OF CALVIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Stories such as those related above make it clear
that rowdyism was likely to be the note of the
Reformation at Geneva so long as Farel remained
at the head of ecclesiastical affairs. With all his
fiery zeal for Gospel truth, he was no better than
a theological demagogue; and what Geneva wanted
at the moment was not a demagogue, but a disciplinarian.
Calvin supplied that need. He was
a Protestant wanderer over the face of the earth,
and he came to Geneva on his way from Italy
to Strassburg. Farel, who had come to know
his own limitations, called upon him in his inn,
and prevailed upon him to stay and help him to
keep order in the town, and, in particular, to help
him to suppress certain Libertines, or Friends of
Liberty, who had been protesting that the Reformers
had no right to ‘require the citizens to attend
sermons against their will,’ and demanding ‘liberty
to live as they chose without reference to what was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
said by the preachers.’ Calvin, after much hesitation,
consented, and so a new era began.</p>

<p>It was not the work of a day. Calvin began
energetically enough, admonishing Bonivard for
undue familiarity with his servant-maid, standing
a gambler in the pillory with a pack of cards hung
round his neck, imprisoning a hairdresser for making
a client look too beautiful, and endeavouring to
throw ridicule upon conjugal infidelity by obliging
an offender to ride round the town on a donkey.
But the recalcitrants fought stubbornly for the
right of living as they chose. The people who
wanted to live dissolute lives allied themselves
with the people who wanted unleavened bread to
be used for the Holy Communion; and the coalition
was powerful enough to get Calvin and Farel
first forbidden to meddle with politics, and then
ordered to leave the town within three days.</p>

<p>They were no sooner gone, however, than they
began to be missed. The disorders, rampant during
their absence, became intolerable, and there was
some danger that the Duke of Savoy might see
his way to take advantage of them. A majority
of the citizens came to the conclusion that strict
regulations were to be preferred to insecurity, and
they sent ambassadors to Calvin, inviting him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
return, and to ‘stay with them for ever because
of his great learning.’ He agreed to do so, and
they voted him a small but sufficient salary, and
gave him a strip of cloth to make him a new gown.
In return, he drafted for their acceptance a new
and original constitution, whereby the morals, and
even the manners, of the community were placed
under ecclesiastical supervision. That was the
famous Theocracy, established in 1541, which
seemed to John Knox to make Geneva ‘the most
perfect school of Christ that ever was in the earth
since the days of the Apostles.’ A recital of a few
of the enactments, taken from a contemporary
translation entitled ‘The Laws and Statutes of
Geneva,’ will be the most simple means of presenting
the picture of the social life of the town
under the regime:</p>

<h3>‘<span class="smcap">The Laws and Statutes of Geneva.</span></h3>

<p>‘Item, that none shall play or run idly in the
streets during the time of Sermons on Sundays,
nor days of prayer, nor to open their shops during
the sermon time under pain without any favour.’</p>

<p>‘Item, that no man, of what estate, quality, or
condition soever he be, dareth be so hardy to make,
or cause to be made, or wear hosen or doublets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
cut, jagged, embroidered, or lined with silk, upon
pain to forfeit.’</p>

<p>‘Item, that no Citizen, Burger, or Inhabitant
of this City dareth be so hardy to go from henceforth
to eat or drink in any Tavern.’</p>

<p>‘Item, that none be so hardy to walk by night
in the Town after nine of the clock, without candle-light
and also a lawful cause.’</p>

<p>‘Item, that no manner of person, of what estate,
quality or condition soever they be, shall wear any
chains of gold or silver, but those which have been
accustomed to wear them shall put them off, and
wear them no more upon pain of three score
shillings for every time.’</p>

<p>‘Item, that no women, of what quality or condition
soever they be, shall wear any verdingales,
gold upon her head, quoises of gold, billiments or
such like, neither any manner of embroidery upon
her sleeves.’</p>

<p>‘Item, that no manner of person, whatsoever

shall have above three courses or services to the
said feasts, and to every course or service not
above four dishes, and yet not excessive, upon

to go to those that be appointed for men.’</p>

<p>‘Item, that no manner of person do sing any
vain, dishonest or ribaldry songs, neither do dance,
nor make masques, mummeries, or any disguisings
in no manner or sort whatsoever it be, upon pain
to be put three days in prison with bread and

<p>‘Item, that all Hosts and Hostesses shall advertise
their guests, and expressly forbid them not
to be out of their lodging after the Trumpet sound
to the Watch or ringing of the Bell (which is at
nine of the clock), upon pain of the indignation of
the Lords.’</p>

<p>‘Item, that all Hosts and others shall make their
prayers to God, and give thanks before meat and
after upon pain of forty shillings and for every
time being found or proved, and if the Hosts

<p>‘Item, that none do enterprise to do, say, nor

of God and Reformation of the Gospel, upon pain
to be punished according as the case requireth.’</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRIUMPH OF THE THEOCRACY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Such was the constitution in theory; and, if we
want to see it at work, we have only to turn to the
Register of the Consistory, in which we may read
how the citizens were punished for peccadilloes.
One woman, we find, got into trouble for saying
her prayers in Latin, and another for wearing
her hair hanging down her back. One man was
punished for wearing baggy knickerbockers in the
street; a second for offering his snuff-box to a
friend during the sermon; a third for talking
business to a neighbour as he was coming out of
church; a fourth for calling his cow by the
Scriptural name Rebecca; a fifth for likening the
braying of his donkey to the chanting of a psalm.
There was also the case of a workman whose
property was confiscated because he did not relieve
the indigence of his aged parents; of a child stood
in the pillory and publicly whipped for throwing
a stone at its mother; of a mother imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
for carelessly dropping her baby on the floor; and
of a young lady solemnly arraigned on the charge
of casting amorous glances at a minister of the
Word.</p>

<p>Not everybody, of course, approved of such
elaborate interference with liberty. The Friends
of Liberty resisted it as long as they could, and
their methods of resistance were not passive.
They set their dogs at Calvin; they openly
ridiculed him; they came drunk to church and
brawled. But Calvin was a match for them.
Pierre Amaulx, who said of him that he ‘thought
as much of himself as if he were a Bishop,’ was
compelled to apologize, bareheaded, in public;
and all those who tried, as Calvin put it, to ‘throw
off the yoke of the Gospel’ came to a bad end.
One of them, Raoul Monnet, was beheaded for
inviting young men to look at indecorous pictures;
and the party was ultimately broken up as the
result of a row in the streets. They were very
drunk, and were threatening certain of the
Reformers with violence, when Syndic Aubert,
hearing their noise, came out and faced them in
his nightgown, carrying his staff of office in one
hand and a lighted candle in the other. Thus
attired and equipped, he placed himself at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
head of the watch, summoned the soldiers to his
aid, and put the rioters to rout. Some of them
were killed in the scuffle; others were captured,
tried, and executed; while the remnant escaped
into the country, where, for a period, they eked
out a precarious existence by means of highway
robbery.</p>

<p>From that time forward Calvin’s supremacy was
undisputed. The principal use which he made of
it was to burn Servetus; but that is a thorny
branch of the subject into which it is better not to
enter. Our modern Calvinists do not, indeed, hold
that Servetus deserved to be burnt, but they do
sometimes maintain that Calvin did no great harm
in burning him. There might be some risk of
putting them to confusion if the topic were
pursued; and this is not a controversial work.
We shall be on safer ground if we turn aside to
consider Calvin’s services to the State as an educationist.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE UNIVERSITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In Old Geneva education had been neglected.
Emperor Charles IV. had offered the citizens a
University in the fourteenth century, and the offer
had been rejected for fear, it was alleged, lest the
students should behave uproariously. The first
public school was not opened in the town until
1429. It lasted for about a hundred years, and
then fell upon evil times during an epidemic of the
plague. The head master ran away from the contagion,
and the City Council ordered the building
to be closed, on the ground that the children were
knocking it to pieces. Then, in 1535, after the
Protestants had gained the upper hand, the École
de la Rive was established in the convent from
which the Cordeliers had been expelled. The first
head-master was Antoine Saulnier, a Dauphiné
Reformer, and his prospectus ran as follows:</p>

<p>‘In our school the lectures begin at five o’clock
in the morning and continue until ten, which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
our usual dinner hour. The ordinary curriculum
consists of instruction in the three most excellent
languages, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, not to
mention the French language, which, in the
opinion of the learned, is by no means to be
despised. We hope that, the Lord helping us, the
time will come when we shall also teach rhetoric
and dialectic.’</p>

<div id="ip_34" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="600" height="444" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">EVIAN LES BAINS, HTE. SAVOIE</div></div>

<p>Calvin, however, wanted something better than
the École de la Rive. He found a means, therefore,
of founding a University, and placed Théodore
de Bèze (of whom more presently) at the head of
it as Rector. It was, at first, as Mark Pattison
clearly proved in his ‘Life of Isaac Casaubon,’
little more than a grammar school, culminating in
a theological college; but it soon expanded, and
is still expanding. Nowadays, indeed, housed in
commodious new buildings, it furnishes instruction
in almost every imaginable branch of knowledge,
and specially favours studies of a utilitarian
character; but the original programme was confined
to the humane letters, the funds for the
maintenance of the institution being raised with
difficulty, and by means of ingenious fiscal devices,
hardly to be held up to the imitation of modern
fiscal reformers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
One device was to ear-mark for the University
chest all the fines imposed upon law-breakers.
Those who gave short measure in the market, and
those who spoke evil of the magistrates, were alike
mulcted in the interests of learning; the heaviest
contribution was that exacted from a bookseller
convicted of having charged an excessive price for a
copy of the Psalms of David. A second method
consisted in summoning all the notaries of the town
before the Council, and instructing them, when any
citizen called them in to make his will, to impress
upon the testator the desirability of bequeathing
something to the University; the result was a
total gain of 1,074 florins, including 312 florins from
Robert Estienne, the printer, and 5 sous from a
poor woman in the baking business. A third
contrivance was to suppress a public banquet, and
require the cost, estimated at 100 florins, to be
handed to the University authorities.</p>

<p>In this way the University&mdash;such as it was&mdash;was
started, with class-rooms for the scholars and
apartments for the professors, who were allowed
to supplement their incomes by taking boarders.
Everything was poorly done, however, and nobody
appears to have been comfortable. Complaints of
one sort and another are recorded, in large numbers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
in the Register of the Council. For one thing,
there was no heating apparatus, but ‘the teachers
used to keep up charcoal fires at their own expense,
and require every pupil to pay something towards
them.’ For another thing, there was no glass in
the windows, and we read that ‘as to the request
of the Principal that glass windows shall be placed
in the class-rooms, it is decided that this shall not
be done, but that the scholars may, if they like, fill
up the apertures with paper.’ The teachers, too,
were constantly expressing dissatisfaction with the
accommodation provided for them. As early as
1559 we have one of them applying for a more
commodious lodging, on the ground that ‘God has
called him to the estate of matrimony.’ A little
later we come upon this note:</p>

<p>‘Claude Bridet requested permission to lodge
above the Tower, where M. Chevalier, lecturer in
Hebrew, used to live, for the sake of his health, and
because the lower ground is damp. Decided that
he must be satisfied with his present apartment, and
that the place to which he refers shall be kept for
someone else.’</p>

<p>In spite of discomfort, however, hard work was
the order of the day. A letter has been preserved
from M. de Bèze, the Rector of the University, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the parent of a pupil, in which he says: ‘I fear I
shall be able to make nothing of your son, for, in
spite of my entreaties, he refuses to work more than
fourteen hours a day.’ The ordinary curriculum
did not call for quite such persistent application as
that, but was, none the less, sufficiently severe.</p>

<p>The day began, at 7 a.m., with prayers, roll-call,
and lessons. At 8.30 there was half an hour’s rest,
during which the pupils were instructed to ‘eat
bread, praying while they did so, without making a
noise.’ From 9 to 10 there were more lessons,
terminating with more prayers; from 10 to 11 the
scholars dined; from 11 to 12 they sang psalms;
from 12 to 1 there were further lessons, inaugurated
by prayer; from 1 to 2 there was a quiet time
devoted to eating, writing, and informal study;
from 2 to 4 there was a final instalment of lessons;
and at 4 there was punishment parade in the great
college hall.</p>

<p>The punishments were mainly corporal, and were
inflicted so frequently that the milder professors
protested. ‘The daily fustigations,’ said Mathurin
Cordier, ‘disgust the children with the study of the
humane letters; moreover, their skins get hardened
like the donkeys’, and they no longer feel the
stripes.’ It should be added, however, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
stripes were not so often inflicted for neglect of
the humane letters as for misbehaviour in church.
The children had to attend three services every
Sunday and one every Wednesday, in addition to
the frequent daily prayers at school. They talked
and played, as children will, to the scandal of their
elders, and they played truant whenever they saw a
chance. It must be admitted to be an indication
of imperfect discipline that these peccadilloes were
often solemnly reviewed before the Town Council,
instead of being summarily dealt with at a Court of
First Instance in the head-master’s study. The
Councillors, however, showed no sentimental
tendency to spare the rod. They might fine
offenders whom their police caught in the streets
when they ought to have been availing themselves
of the means of grace; but they also very generally
turned them over to the scholastic authorities to be
whipped. A typical case is that of two lads who
were caught playing quoits on the ramparts during
the hours of Divine service on a Sunday morning.</p>

<span class="subhead">PROFESSOR ANDREW MELVILL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It does not appear that the fustigations at first
formed brilliant scholars. The University was, for
a long time, more famous for its professors than for
its pupils. Few learned men, at that period, were
regarded as prophets in their own countries; and a
goodly proportion of those who were so regarded
had to emigrate for fear of being stoned. Many of
the fugitives settled at Geneva, and taught there;
and the readiness of the welcome accorded to the
men who were considered suitable may be illustrated
from the career of Andrew Melvill, the
Scottish scholar, who subsequently reformed the
Scottish Universities, and went to profess theology
at Sedan. Andrew Melvill had been teaching in
a college at Poictiers, and the town had been
besieged by the Huguenots. <span class="locked">Then&mdash;</span></p>

<p>‘The siege of the town being raised, he left
Poictiers, and accompanied by a Frenchman, he
took journey to Geneva, leaving books and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
there, and carried nothing with him but a little
Hebrew Bible in his belt. So he came to Geneva,
all upon foot, and as he had done before from
Dieppe to Paris, and from that to Poictiers; for
he was small and light of body, but full of spirits,
vigorous, and courageous. His companions of the
way, when they came to the inn, would lie down
like tired dogs, but he would out and sight the
towns and villages, whithersoever they came. The
ports of Geneva were carefully kept, because of the
troubles of France, and the multitude of strangers
that came. Being therefore inquired what they
were, the Frenchman, his companion, answered:</p>

<p>‘“We are poor scholars.”</p>

<p>‘But Mr. Andrew, perceiving that they had no
wish for poor folks, being already overlaid therewith,
said:</p>

<p>‘“No, no; we are not poor! We have as much
as will pay for all we take as long as we tarry.
We have letters from his acquaintance to Monsieur
de Bèze; let us deliver those, we crave no further.”</p>

<p>‘And so, being convoyed to Beza and then to
their lodging, Beza perceiving him a scholar, and
they having need of a Professor of Humanity in the
College, put him within two or three days to trial
in Virgil and Homer; wherein he could acquit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
himself so well that without further ado, he is
placed in that room of profession; and at his first
entry a quarter’s fee is paid him in hand. So that
howbeit there was but a crown to the fore betwixt
them both, and the Frenchman weak-spirited and
wist not what to do, yet he found God’s providence
to relieve both himself and help his companion till
he was provided.’</p>

<p>There follows a picture of Melvill’s life in the
city:</p>

<p>‘In Geneva he abode five years; during the
which time his chief study was Divinity, whereon
he heard Beza’s daily lessons and preachings;
Cornelius Bonaventura, Professor of the Hebrew,
Chaldaic, and Syriac languages; Portus, a Greek
born, Professor of the Greek tongue, with whom
he would reason about the right pronunciation
thereof; for the Greek pronounced it after the
common form, keeping the accents; the which
Mr. Andrew controlled by precepts and reason, till
the Greek would grow angry and cry out:</p>

<p>‘“<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vos Scoti, vos barbari! docebitis nos Græcos
pronunciationem linguæ nostræ, scilicet?</i>”</p>

<p>‘He heard there also Francis Hotman, the
renownedst lawyer in his time. There he was
well acquainted with my uncle, Mr. Henry Scrymgeour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
who, by his learning in the laws and policy
and service of many noble princes, had attained to
great riches, acquired a pretty plot of ground
within a league of Geneva, and built thereon a
trim house called “the Vilet,” and a fair lodging
within the town, all which, with a daughter, his
only born, he left to the Syndics of the town.’</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="subhead">THÉODORE DE BÈZE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Calvin died and was buried with his fathers&mdash;not
before it was time, in the opinion of a good many
of his critics&mdash;and was succeeded in the dictatorship
by Théodore de Bèze, whose name is commonly
latinized as Beza.</p>

<p>The two men had always worked well together;
but they differed widely both in their antecedents
and in their dispositions. Calvin, a theologian
from his earliest years, had had no hot youth, no
unregenerate days. Monsieur de Bèze, born of a
good old Burgundian family, had been a man of
the world before he became a man of God; before
he versified the Psalms he had written verses
which his enemies described as indecorous; when
he enrolled himself among the Reformers, the first
person whom he had to reform was himself; for,
though there does not seem to be any truth in the
statement of the Jesuit Maimbourg that he had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
love-affair with the wife of a tailor, there is no
denying that he had betrayed a young woman of
humble birth under promise of marriage, and had
allowed four years to elapse before fulfilling his
promise. Moreover, he kept his high spirits when
he settled down to virtuous courses; and his
fellow-citizens were so delighted with his jollity
that it became a saying in Geneva that it would be
better to go to hell with Beza than to heaven with
Calvin.</p>

<div id="ip_44" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="600" height="446" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">YVOIRE, HTE. SAVOIE</div></div>

<p>As a man of letters M. de Bèze was principally
occupied with theological controversy, and, as
has been said, with the production of his metrical
version of the Psalms of David; but his contributions
to religious disputation sometimes took the
form of farce and burlesque. He was part author
of a satire entitled <cite>Cuisine Papale</cite>, and devoted his
great gifts to the composition of a rollicking drinking
song, in which a certain burner of heretics thus
bewails the loss of his nose:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span></p><div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">‘O nose that must with drink be dyed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O nose, my glory and my pride!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O nose, that didst enjoy a-right&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nose, my alembic of delight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bibulous big bottle-nose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As highly coloured as the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="iq">‘It was my hope that thou wouldst share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My shifting fortunes everywhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Churchman’s nose thou wast indeed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The partner of his prayers and creed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proof against all doctrinal shocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never aught but orthodox.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Let that suffice. It is rather vulgar fooling;
but to have omitted all mention of it would have
been to give an imperfect impression of the
Reformer. He owed some of his influence with
the vulgar to the fact that he knew how to descend
to their level; and he needed all his influence, for
he had to guide Geneva through perilous times.
There was a terrible epidemic of the plague;
innumerable fugitives from the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew took refuge in the town; there was
a long war with Savoy.</p>

<p>In the case of the plague the difficulty was, as it
always had been at Geneva, to compel the doctors
and the clergy to do their duty to the sick. A
note in the Register of the Council shows us how,
in the days before the Reform, the monks had
envisaged their obligations. The canons of the
cathedral, it there appears, passed the following
resolution:</p>

<p>‘In view of the fact that the plague is suspected
to exist in the town, the reverend fathers vote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
themselves a month’s holiday from the duty of
residing there and attending to the services; their
stipends, in the meantime, to continue to be
paid.’</p>

<p>The month’s holiday, we also gather, was subsequently
extended to a year, with the same liberal
stipulation as to emoluments; and after the
Reformation we find the Protestant clergy displaying
an equal timidity in the presence of the
disease. The entry concerning them runs thus:</p>

<p>‘The ministers appeared before the Council confessing
that it was their duty to go and offer consolation
to the sufferers from the plague, but that
not one of them had the courage to do so. They
begged the Council to overlook their weakness,
seeing that God had not given them the grace to
brave and overcome the peril with the intrepidity
required&mdash;always excepting Matthew Geneston,
who is quite willing to go, if the lot should fall
upon him.’</p>

<p>M. de Bèze, one is glad to know, was made of
sterner stuff than these weak brethren. Not only
were the sick properly visited during his term of
office. Precautions&mdash;fatuous, but well meant&mdash;were
taken against the propagation of the disorder.
The Register of the Council is full of references to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
them. Sufferers were ordered not to open their
windows; convalescents were enjoined to carry
white sticks when they went abroad, in order that
they might be recognized and avoided; it was forbidden
to eat fruit or to take a bath, as this was
believed to be a means of catching the infection.
We have a note on hospital reform. It was
ordered that male and female patients should be
treated in separate wards, in order that certain
scandals might be prevented. We find a doctor
reprimanded for doing his duty negligently. ‘The
Sieur Bauhin, plague-doctor, is ordered to see his
patients in their houses instead of being satisfied
with having them brought to the window for a
consultation.’ Finally, we read that ‘the Council,
at the request of the Ministers, orders all the
citizens to frequent the sermons with assiduity, in
order to turn away the wrath of God which would
appear, from the continuance of the plague, to be
violently aroused against the town.’</p>

<p>Then, while the plague was still lingering, came
the news of the dreadful doings of St. Bartholomew’s
Day. Merchants from Lyons brought the
tidings, predicting the speedy arrival of the victims
who had escaped the butchery; and preparations
were made to entertain them hospitably. M. de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Bèze dispatched pastors to greet them at the
frontier, and preached a sermon on the situation,
bidding the citizens decree a special day of prayer
and fasting&mdash;the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Jeûne Genevois</i>, which is still
observed, though as an occasion of junketing rather
than of abstinence.</p>

<p>On that occasion, however, the Genevans were
very far from junketing. They did indeed fast and
pray; and on the first day of September the
arrival of the long train of fugitives began. They
were truly fugitives rather than immigrants; that
is to say, they had fled empty-handed, travelled in
hourly terror of their lives, and arrived in a state of
utter destitution. Let it be added that there were
2,300 of them, and that contemporary statistics
show that there were in Geneva, at that period,
only 1,200 householders. Imagining the sudden
influx of 2,300 paupers into a town of the size of
Sandwich, one begins to realize the economic situation
thus created. To realize it completely one
must further remember that Geneva was already
on the verge of bankruptcy; and that a collection,
for the benefit of the fugitives, which realized 4,000
livres, so exhausted the resources of the town that
the proposal to make a second collection had to be
abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Severe economy was naturally the order of the
day. The only recorded example of public extravagance
during this period is an order that, as
the chairs in the Council Chamber were too hard
for the comfort of the Councillors, they should be
padded; and even this outlay may have been due
to a desire to find work for those who needed it.
On the other hand, the indications of distress are
numerous and startling.</p>

<p>One such indication is furnished by the report of
a debate of the Venerable Company of Pastors. It
was proposed that a deputation should wait upon
the magistrates ‘to inform them how scantily they
provide for their clergy in times when everything is
dear, the fact being that even ministers with no
families but only wives to support are absolutely
unable to live upon their salaries.’ But the proposal
was rejected on the ground that the magistrates
were already aware of the distress of the
clergy, and could do little to help them, and that
it would never do for it to be said that the clergy
had applied for increased emoluments at a time of
general impoverishment. ‘It is better,’ the resolution
continued, ‘to endure our sufferings, leaving it
to God to relieve them when it seems good to Him;
but if any of our brethren are too hard pressed, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
may declare their condition to the magistrates, and
ask assistance from them privately.’</p>

<p>Still more sorrowful was the case of the immigrant
pastors from France, who had no wages.
The magistrates distributed a certain amount of
money among them, and advised them that, as no
more was likely to be forthcoming, they would be
wise to lay out a part of it in learning a business or
a trade. Their reply is worth preserving:</p>

<p>‘For several weeks,’ they said, ‘their position had
been very painful; they felt their indebtedness to
the Genevans the more acutely because no one
reminded them of it; and they had decided to do
with as little as possible to eat until the spring,
when they hoped to have better news from their
own country.’</p>

<span class="subhead">WAR WITH SAVOY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The situation righted itself by degrees, with the
help of subscriptions from other Swiss cities; but
then there was another deadly peril to be faced.
The pretensions of Savoy were not yet extinguished.
The Duke was still determined to capture Geneva,
whether by violence or by stealth, believing that
the act would be equally advantageous to the
Church and to himself. Two attempts to ‘rush’
the town in time of peace&mdash;once by means of
soldiers who were to enter concealed in barges
laden with wood, and once by means of armed men
disguised as muleteers&mdash;induced the Council to
meet and resolve to ‘ask the advice of God and
M. de Bèze’; and, from 1589 onwards, there was
open war, in which 2,186 Genevans held their
own against 18,000 Savoyards.</p>

<p>The atrocities committed by the Savoyard
soldiers were numerous and terrible. We read
of one prisoner of war being skinned alive; of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
another who, with his feet amputated, was driven
about on a donkey with his face to the tail, and
then flung on a dunghill to die. We also read of
peasants being hung up to be roasted alive over
the fire-places in their own cottages. It is not
wonderful that the Genevan soldiers held that this
sort of thing gave them the right to retaliate, at
least by pillaging, when they gained the upper hand.
The wonderful thing is that, when they did pillage,
M. de Bèze called them to order, and was listened
to. He told them that they were degrading
Geneva to the level of a brigand’s cave, and bade
them make instant restitution of the plunder which
they had taken from the peasantry. It is recorded
that they obeyed him, and there could be no better
proof that M. de Bèze was a strong man.</p>

<p>These hostilities came to an end in 1589, owing
to the intervention of Henri IV. of France; but
the peril was not conjured. Baffled in the field,
Duke Charles Emmanuel fell back upon treachery,
and planned the adventure known to history as the
Escalade. It is the most notable episode in all the
Genevan annals. Fragments of scaling-ladders,
kept as memorials of the ignominious failure of the
enterprise, are still proudly exhibited in one of the
town museums. The story must be told at length.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ESCALADE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The time was December, 1602. Duke Charles
Emmanuel had secretly crossed the mountains, and
established his head-quarters at Etrembières; a
sufficient army had been quietly mobilized; there
were 800 Savoyards, 1,000 Spaniards, 400 Neapolitans,
and 4,000 Piedmontese at Bonne, La
Roche, Bonneville, and other places near Geneva.
The Duke had also been at pains to allay suspicion
by assuring the Genevans, through his agents, that
he desired nothing more than to be on friendly
terms with them. But at midnight of December
12 he set his troops in motion.</p>

<p>A storming-party of some two hundred men
led the way, under the command of M. Berlonière,
who had extreme unction administered to him
ostentatiously before he started. The main body
of 4,000 men was to follow under Lieutenant-General
d’Albigni. Acting on information received,
the storming-party struck the Corraterie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
rampart at a point where there was no sentinel on
the look-out for them. They carried with them
faggots and hurdles to help them over the moat,
ladders that could be dovetailed together to scale
the rampart with, and axes and crowbars for breaking
down or forcing gates. A Scotch Jesuit, named
Alexander, gave them his benediction as they
climbed, and handed to every man an amulet
which purported to guarantee him in the first
instance against being killed, and in the second
instance against being damned eternally if he were
killed.</p>

<p>Fortune at first smiled upon their efforts. They
succeeded in attaining the rampart unobserved, and
kept quiet, waiting for d’Albigni and the dawn.
A single sentinel whom they met was slain in
silence. But presently a small company of the
watch passed by upon its rounds. Upon these, too,
the soldiers flung themselves, and most of them
were quickly pitched over into the moat. One
gun went off, however, and one man managed to
escape. He was the drummer, and he ran along
the rampart, drumming as he went, as far as the
Porte de la Monnaie. It was enough. The alarm
was given. The invaders saw that they must fight
in the dark, instead of waiting for the dawn. ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Espagne!</i>’ they shouted. ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ville gagnée! Tue, Tue!</i>’
and dashed down into the streets, expecting
d’Albigni and his 4,000 men to follow them.</p>

<p>But this was what d’Albigni and his 4,000 men
could not do. Chance&mdash;or the hand of Providence&mdash;had
interfered to save Geneva. A message to
say that the city was as good as captured had
already been sent off to the Duke of Savoy at
Etrembières; and the Duke was dispatching
couriers to announce his victory at all the Courts
of Europe. But it happened that the Genevans at
the Porte Neuve loaded a cannon to the muzzle
with chains, and any other old iron that came to
hand, and fired it in a direction parallel with the
rampart. Had the aim been bad, Geneva would
have fallen that night beyond a doubt. But the
aim was good, and the shot broke the ladders into
pieces, so that no one could climb by them any
more; and there was Lieutenant-General d’Albigni
with his army helpless in the moat, while the storming
party was caught in a trap within the walls.
The citizens snatched up their weapons, and hurried
down, half dressed, to give them battle in the dark.
Their pastor, Simon Goulart,<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> who wrote a jubilant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
description of the episode, declared that he himself
would have been delighted to join in the affray if
only he had had a coat of mail. A worthy woman,
who was making soup for an early breakfast, flung
the scalding fluid, saucepan and all, out of window
on to the heads of the intruders. Other missiles were
showered upon them from other windows; while
the number of armed men who faced them in the
open steadily increased. In the end, after inflicting
upon the Genevans a loss of seventeen killed
and twenty wounded, they were swept back into
the moat, leaving many dead and thirteen prisoners
behind them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Simon Goulart (1543&ndash;1628) was a Frenchman, who
accepted the Reformation in 1565, and came to Geneva in
1566. In 1572 he was made pastor of the Church of St.
Gervais. After the death of M. de Bèze he became President
of the Venerable Company. He wrote more than fifty books
on various subjects.</p></div>

<p>‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Misérable butor, vous avez fait une belle cacade</i>’&mdash;‘Blockhead,
you have made a pretty mess of it’&mdash;was
Charles Emmanuel’s greeting to d’Albigni
when he heard the truth; and with that he
mounted his horse and rode away to Turin, without
even troubling to hear the fate of his prisoners.
These, it should be added, were all beheaded in the
course of the next day; while the heads of those
who had been killed were collected and spiked, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
an ornament to the ramparts and a terror to evil-doers.</p>

<p>M. de Bèze, who was now an old man and very
deaf, had slept through the fighting undisturbed,
and knew nothing of it until his friends told him
the story the next morning. Though he had
now retired from the active duties of the pastorate,
he dressed himself and went down to the Cathedral
of St. Pierre, where he mounted the pulpit stairs
and called upon the congregation to sing Psalm
cxxiv.&mdash;the Psalm which begins:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘If the Lord Himself had not been on our side, now may
Israel say: if the Lord Himself had not been on our side,
when men rose up against us.’</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The Psalm which ends:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Our soul is escaped, even as a bird out of the snare of the
fowler: the snare is broken, and we are delivered.</p>

<p>‘Our help standeth in the name of the Lord: who hath
made heaven and earth.’</p></blockquote>

<p>It was the old Reformer’s last public appearance&mdash;and
a fitting one, giving as it does the last
dramatic touch to the most dramatic incident in
Genevan annals. He lived until 1605, but he
was growing feebler and feebler. He suffered from
no actual malady, but it was obvious to all that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
light was flickering out. His intellect, however,
was clear until the last, and the picture of his last
days, drawn by his biographer, Antoine La Faye,
recalls Bunyan’s picture of the Christian pilgrims
waiting in the Land of Beulah for their summons
to cross the river to the shining city.</p>

<p>The Venerable Company of Pastors in conclave
resolved that no day should be allowed to pass
without at least two of their number paying him a
visit. For the rest he found his pleasure in reading
grave and pious colloquies and sermons, and particularly
in those words of Augustine: ‘Long have
I lived; long have I sinned. Blessed be the name
of the Lord!’ And, at the last, ‘without pain, and
without a struggle, all his senses, as it seemed, failing
him simultaneously, in one single instant, he
gave back his soul to God, his bodily pilgrimage
having lasted eighty-six years, three months, and
nine days, and forty of his years having been spent
in the holy office of the ministry.’</p>

<p>‘M. de Bèze,’ La Faye continues, ‘was a man of
sturdy build, conspicuous beauty, and health so
vigorous that he often said that he did not know
the meaning of a headache. He displayed high
talents, accurate judgment, a tenacious memory,
and remarkable eloquence, while in courtesy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
manner he was second to no one. In view of the
great gifts thus recited, and his great age (though
these are things less to be regarded than his learning
and his piety), many used to speak of M. de Bèze
as the Phœnix of his time.’</p>

<span class="subhead">AN INTERVAL OF QUIET</span></h2>
</div>

<p>M. de Bèze was succeeded in the Presidency of
the Venerable Company of Pastors by Simon
Goulart&mdash;the warrior whom we have seen excusing
himself for not fighting against the Duke of Savoy
on the ground that he had no coat of mail. In his
new office, however, Simon needed no armour,
for the period from the Escalade of 1603 to the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 was
quiet and uneventful. The great name of the
epoch was that of Jean Diodati, Milton’s friend,
the theologian who pulverized the Arminians at
the Synod of Dordrecht. Other names are those
of Trembley, Tronchin, Turretini, and Calendrini;
and there is not a name among them which need
detain us. The town was at peace with its neighbours;
commerce and industry flourished; and the
ecclesiastical discipline gradually lost its grip upon
the city, or was, at least, restricted to a narrower
field of usefulness. We hear of a good many new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
sumptuary laws, but we also gather that many of
them were only a means of accentuating class
distinctions, and that there was a growing difficulty
in enforcing them. We find persons burnt alive
for witchcraft at the beginning of the period, but
not towards the end of it; we hear of doubts
diffusing themselves as to the efficacy of torture
in extracting the truth from witnesses; and we find
even heresy dealt with less rigorously than of old.
A heretic who was sentenced to be ‘strangled in
the usual manner’ had the sentence, without difficulty,
commuted into one of ten years’ banishment.</p>

<p>The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes inevitably
brought a fresh flood of immigrants&mdash;1,450 in a
single week, 800 in a single day&mdash;but Geneva was
by no means disposed to welcome them so hospitably
as in the time of M. de Bèze. Seventy years of
prosperity had sapped some of the primitive virtues
of the people; they had conceived a dread of
foreign competition, and of the pauper alien, even
though the pauper alien was an exile for conscience’
sake. Their disposition was rather to seek excuses
for passing the pauper aliens on, and make them
chargeable upon the hospitality of their Swiss allies,
or of the Germans or the Dutch. To some extent
they succeeded; but a considerable number of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
immigrants settled in the town in spite of the
political disabilities imposed upon them, and soon
became a source of trouble. All through the
eighteenth century&mdash;or at all events from 1707
until 1794&mdash;there was intermittent political turmoil.
A detailed account of the agitations and disturbances
hardly falls within the scope of such a work
as the present; but it may be as well to sum them
up, and describe their general character.</p>

<span class="subhead">REVOLUTIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Transvaal troubles which culminated in the
South African War may furnish an analogy which
will help to make the situation clear; the story
being, in fact, a long story of acrimonious relations
between Burghers and Uitlanders. The Burghers
were, in the main, the descendants of the families
already possessed of the rights of citizenship in the
half-century following the Reformation; the Uitlanders
were the descendants of immigrants who
had settled in the city since that period. The
Burghers enjoyed political rights, and the Uitlanders
did not; the gulf between the two classes
was only occasionally passed by an exceptional
Uitlander whom the Burghers considered ‘fit.’
By degrees, however, the Uitlanders became more
numerous than the Burghers, and a form of government
which had been a democracy became an
oligarchy, in which many of the most intelligent
and reputable citizens had no voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
For a time the system worked well enough, or
at all events worked without any outward signs of
friction; but throughout the eighteenth century
friction was constantly occurring, and insurrections,
described by some historians as revolutions, broke
out at intervals. There were revolutions of sorts
in 1707, in 1737, in 1766, in 1782, and in 1789, with
minor revolutions intervening. The recognized
mode of composing the troubles was to invite the
mediation of foreign Powers, and more particularly
of France. The first step of the French mediator
was generally, as we shall see, to demand that a
theatre should be opened and a company of
comedians installed in it for his diversion. But he
also mediated, the result of his mediation being to
arrange a compromise between the rival claims.
Each compromise did something to improve the
position of the Uitlanders; but no compromise
really removed their grievances or satisfied their
claims.</p>

<p>This brings us to the date of the French Revolution,
which, as was inevitable in the circumstances,
had its very audible repercussion at Geneva. The
doctrine that ‘all men are equal before the law, and
ought to enjoy the same political rights,’ was seed
which fell there upon a fruitful soil. As might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
have been expected, French methods of propagandism
were imitated, and Jacobinical clubs
were formed&mdash;the Sans-culottes, the Montagnards,
the Marseillais, the Égalité. The clubmen constituted
a party known as the Égaliseurs, or
Equalitarians, and demanded a new constitution,
based upon the principle of the sovereignty of the
people, and the admission of all Uitlanders to the
full rights of citizenship. On the night of September
4, 1792, there was a rising. The gates of the
town were seized; the members of the Government
were arrested; a Provisional Government was
proclaimed, with the mission of drafting a new
constitution on the approved democratic lines.</p>

<p>So far, so good. But the account of what
follows reads like a burlesque of the revolutionary
proceedings across the frontier. The workmen left
their work, and paraded the streets in red caps,
singing revolutionary songs. The extremists
banded themselves into a society styled ‘the
Tanners,’ pledged to ‘tan,’ or assault and batter,
the aristocrats, whom they called Englués, or Stick-in-the-muds,
whenever and wherever they met them
taking their walks abroad. Nor did such informal
acts of violence suffice. The next step was to
arrest all the aristocrats who had not fled from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
town, lock them up in the Grenier de Chantepoulet,
and improvise a revolutionary tribunal to
judge them.</p>

<div id="ip_68" class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">
  <img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="416" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">MONTENVERS AND AIGUILLES VERTE AND DRU</div></div>

<p>The proceedings of the tribunal were conducted
with true republican <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans-gêne</i>. The judges sat
on the bench in their shirt-sleeves, with their pipes
in their mouths and their pistols in their belts.
Happily, however, as if they were half conscious
that their proceedings were farcical, they were
less murderous in their sentences than their
French models. Though 600 aristocrats were
condemned, the majority of them escaped with
sentences of fines, imprisonment, or exile, and the
death sentence was only passed upon seven of them.
The seven were shot by torch-light at the Bastions;
and then the people began to be horrified by the
atrocities which they had perpetrated. There was
a reaction, a counter-revolution, and a great
ceremony of reconciliation in the cathedral. The
leaders of the rival factions shook hands in the
presence of the assembled populace, and swore to
forgive and forget and work together thenceforward
for the good of their common country. They kept
their oaths, and all promised well until the French
Directorate cast covetous eyes upon Geneva, found
a pretext for its annexation, and made it the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
capital of the new department of Leman. It
remained French until the last day of the year
1813, when Napoleon’s misfortunes gave the citizens
the opportunity of throwing off the yoke, and
they sought and obtained admission to the Swiss
Confederation.</p>

<span class="subhead">LITERATURE AND SCIENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It has been remarked as curious that the Age of
Revolution at Geneva was also the Golden Age&mdash;if
not of Genevan literature, which has never
really had any Golden Age, at least of Genevan
science, which was of world-wide renown. The
explanation probably is that these Genevan revolutions,
over which the Genevan historians have spilt
such a quantity of ink, were not such very important
matters after all. So far as one can make out,
the graver of them were hardly more grave than the
Peterloo massacre, while the less grave hardly attain
to the gravity of the Bloody Sunday Riots. A
man of letters who took part in one of them on the
losing side might suffer unpleasant consequences.
He might have his writings burnt by the common
hangman, as Bérenger’s were; he might be driven
into exile, as were de Lolme, who went to London,
where he wrote his famous work on the British
Constitution, and d’Ivernois, who went to Paris<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and became one of the most pungent critics of
republican administration and finance. Such
things might happen, and in many cases did.
But there were no such violent or such continual
disturbances as need take up the whole of a literary
man’s time, or prevent him from getting on with
his work.</p>

<p>The period, at any rate, is one in which notable
names meet us at every turn. There were exiled
Genevans, like de Lolme, holding their own in
foreign political and intellectual circles; there were
emigrant Genevan pastors holding aloft the lamps
of culture and piety in many cities of England,
France, Russia, Germany, and Denmark; there
were Genevans, like François Lefort, holding the
highest offices in the service of foreign rulers; and
there were numbers of Genevans at Geneva of
whom the cultivated grand tourist wrote in the
tone of a disciple writing of his master. One
cannot glance at the history of the period without
lighting upon names of note in almost all departments
of endeavour. The period is that of de
Saussure, Bourrit, the de Lucs, the two Hubers,
great authorities respectively on bees and birds; Le
Sage, who was one of Gibbon’s rivals for the heart
of Mademoiselle Suzanne Curchod; Senebier, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
librarian who wrote the first literary history of
Geneva; St. Ours and Arlaud, the painters;
Charles Bonnet, the entomologist; Bérenger and
Picot, the historians; Tronchin, the physician;
Trembley and Jallabert, the mathematicians;
Dentan, minister and Alpine explorer; Pictet,
the editor of the <cite>Bibliothèque Universelle</cite>, still the
leading Swiss literary review; and Odier, who
taught Geneva the virtue of vaccination.</p>

<p>It is obviously impossible to dwell at length upon
the careers of all these eminent men. As well might
one attempt, in a survey on the same scale of English
literature, to discuss in detail the careers of all the
celebrities of the age of Anne. One can do little
more than remark that the list is marvellously
strong for a town of some 30,000 inhabitants, and
that many of the names included in it are not only
eminent, but interesting. Jean André de Luc, for
example, has a double claim upon our attention as
the inventor of the hygrometer and as the pioneer
of the snow-peaks. He climbed the Buet as early
as 1770, and wrote an account of his adventures on
its summit and its slopes which has the true charm
of Arcadian simplicity. He came to England, was
appointed reader to Queen Charlotte, and lived in
the enjoyment of that office, and in the gratifying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
knowledge that Her Majesty kept his presentation
hygrometer in her private apartments, to the
venerable age of ninety.</p>

<p>Bourrit is another interesting character&mdash;being,
in fact, the spiritual ancestor of the modern Alpine
Clubman. By profession he was Precentor of the
Cathedral; but his heart was in the mountains.
In the summer he climbed them, and in the winter
he wrote books about them. One of his books
was translated into English; and the list of subscribers,
published with the translation, shows
that the public which Bourrit addressed included
Edmund Burke, Sir Joseph Banks, Bartolozzi,
Fanny Burney, Angelica Kauffman, David Garrick,
Sir Joshua Reynolds, George Augustus Selwyn,
Jonas Hanway, and Dr. Johnson. His writings
earned him the honourable title of Historian
(or Historiographer) of the Alps. Men of science
wrote him letters; princes engaged upon the
grand tour called to see him; princesses sent
him presents as tokens of their admiration and
regard for the man who had taught them how the
contemplation of mountain scenery might exalt
the sentiments of the human mind.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE JURA RANGE FROM THONON, HTE. SAVOIE</div></div>

<p>Tronchin, too, is interesting; he was the first
physician who recognized the therapeutic use of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
fresh air and exercise, hygienic boots, and open
windows. And so is Charles Bonnet, who was not
afraid to stand up for orthodoxy against Voltaire;
and so is Mallet, who travelled as far as Lapland.
But space forbids any long examination of their
achievements. The most that one can do is to
illustrate the epoch by narrating the events of one
career; and the career selected must of necessity
be that of the man of whom his contemporaries
always spoke, with the reverence of hero-worshippers,
as ‘the illustrious de Saussure.’</p>

<span class="subhead">SAUSSURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Horace Benedict de Saussure, who, like so many
eminent Genevans, was of French extraction, was
born in 1740. Nominally, his work in life, entered
upon at the age of twenty-two, was that of Professor
of Philosophy at the Geneva University;
but his real work, continued almost until his death,
was that of the explorer, student, and exponent of
the mountains. Some time before the end he was
able to boast that he had crossed the Alps by eight
different passes, made sixteen other excursions to
the centre of the range, and travelled in the Jura,
the Vosges, and the mountains of Dauphiné. His
marriage&mdash;he married young&mdash;by no means hindered
him from climbing. Madame de Saussure indeed
objected, quite failing to understand his readiness
to forsake the comforts of the hearth in order to
revolutionize the science of geology. But he put
his foot down in a letter which may perhaps be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
read with profit by other ladies besides her to
whom it was addressed:</p>

<p>‘In this valley, which I had not previously
visited, I have made observations of the greatest
importance, surpassing my highest hopes; but that
is not what you care about. You would sooner&mdash;God
forgive me for saying so&mdash;see me growing
fat like a friar, and snoring every day in the
chimney-corner after a big dinner, than that I
should achieve immortal fame by the most
sublime discoveries, at the cost of reducing my
weight by a few ounces and spending a few weeks
away from you. If, then, I continue to undertake
these journeys in spite of the annoyance they cause
you, the reason is that I feel myself pledged in
honour to go on with them, and that I think it
necessary to extend my knowledge of this subject,
and make my works as nearly perfect as possible.
I say to myself: Just as an officer goes out to
assault the fortress when the order is given, and
just as a merchant goes to market on market-day,
so must I go to the mountain when there are
observations to be made.’</p>

<p>Nor was it only in the domestic circle that de
Saussure could put his foot down if required.
In one of the Genevan revolutions&mdash;that of 1782&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>he
also showed his mettle in an energetic fashion.
He was a magistrate at the time, and one day,
when he came down to the Hôtel de Ville, he
found that the popular party had risen in revolt,
and seized the building. The rioters requested
him to take his place, and exercise magisterial
functions on lines which they would dictate.
When he refused, they arrested him, but released
him on the following day. Then, hearing that they
proposed to search his house for arms, he decided
to resist. He, Trembley, the mathematician, his
family, his servants, and his dog, constituted the
tiny garrison. They barricaded the doors, stationed
themselves at the windows armed with muskets,
and successfully defied a gang of revolutionists who
came to blow them up with hand-grenades. His
assailants were reduced to threatening to murder
his friends if he did not surrender; and it was only
this final menace that brought about the capitulation
of the Genevan Fort Chabrol.</p>

<p>Our business here, however, is not with the
politician, but with the traveller and the man of
science. His widest celebrity is no doubt due to
his famous ascent of Mont Blanc. If he was not
the first man to climb that mountain, he was, at
any rate, the first to believe that it could be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
climbed. Bourrit, as late as 1773, had written of
‘the absolute impossibility of attaining to its
summit.’ De Saussure, as early as 1760, had
offered a reward to anyone who could find a way
to the top, and undertaken to pay a day’s wages to
anyone who tried and failed. The reward was not
claimed until twenty-six years later, when Jacques
Balmat got it. When the way was found, de
Saussure, though now forty-seven years of age, at
once made haste to follow it. His ascent&mdash;the
third&mdash;was accomplished on August 3, 1787; he
published a short pamphlet, giving an account of
it, in the course of the same year.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE AIGUILLE AND DÔME DU GOÛTER, MONT BLANC</div></div>

<p>The climb was, beyond question, a great feat for
a philosopher of forty-seven, and it brought the
name of de Saussure under the notice of thousands
of people who would never otherwise have heard of
him. A still greater feat, accomplished a little
later, was the camping out, for something over a
fortnight, on the Col du Géant. But it is not
upon either of these feats that de Saussure’s real
fame reposes. He is reckoned among great men
partly because he was the first student of geology
who knew his business, and partly because he is
the only Alpine writer of his period whose works
have stood the test of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
The geologists who preceded him fall into two
classes. There were the mere fossilizers, who had
about as much claim to be considered men of
science as have the stamp-collectors of the present
day; there were the theorists who geologized, so to
say, in the air, threw out hasty generalizations from
their studies, and thought it beneath their dignity
as philosophers to correct these hypotheses by the
further observation of phenomena. De Saussure
combined their methods. His life was one long,
patient study of geological phenomena. But he
collected in order to collate; his aim was always
to see the part in its relation to the whole, the
particular in its relation to the general; and he had
a fine contempt for the amateurs who collected
fossils in the same spirit in which they might have
collected pottery or bric-à-brac.</p>

<p>‘The one aim,’ he wrote, ‘of most of the travellers
who call themselves naturalists is the collection of
curiosities. They walk, or rather they creep about,
with their eyes fixed upon the earth, picking up a
specimen here and a specimen there, without any
eye to a generalization. They remind me of an
antiquary scratching the ground at Rome, in the
midst of the Pantheon or the Coliseum, looking for
fragments of coloured glass, without ever turning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
to look at the architecture of these magnificent
edifices.’</p>

<p>The most remarkable thing, however, is that
de Saussure, being a geologist, should have been a
stylist. He certainly never meant to be one. He
would never have written a book merely to show
his skill in word-painting; his one purpose in
writing was to communicate discoveries of importance.
At the time when Bourrit was making
himself famous by his picturesque descriptions of
the Alps, the greater man wrote to him modestly:
‘I too have an idea of publishing something on the
natural history of these mountains. It is with that
end in view that I have been studying them for so
many years.’ And in the introduction of his great
work, he apologizes for what seems to him the
baldness of his style: ‘More practised in climbing
rocks than in polishing phrases, I have attempted
nothing more than to render clearly the objects
which I have seen, and the impressions which I
have felt.’</p>

<p>It was an apology offered without affectation
or false modesty. It announced a departure from
the literary fashion of the day, which was to write
of the mountains in the language of high-flown
sentiment. Rousseau had set the fashion; Ramond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
de Carbonnière, the philosopher of the Pyrenees,
was ready to carry it on; de Luc and Bourrit were
doing what they could. De Saussure wished to
announce himself as the disciple of none of these,
but as the plain man who had made a careful study
of his subject, and wished to be heard because of
what he had to say and not because of his manner
of saying it. He hardly understood that he was,
in the full sense of the word, a man of letters&mdash;a
literary artist. That is a point which has since
been settled in his favour by his readers.</p>

<p>He might easily have written a treatise that
would have been invaluable to specialists and
intolerable to everyone else. Guided by a sure
instinct, he preferred to write the narrative of his
journeys, taking the reader, as it were, by the hand,
making him his confidant, showing him his discoveries
in the order in which he makes them, and
so luring him on to take an interest in a subject
generally accounted dull. And, though his first
care was always to observe, and to collate his
observations, with a view to the advancement of
learning, there always was in him something of the
poet, which must out from time to time, temporarily
giving the go-by to the man of science.</p>

<p>One finds this vein of poetry in the writings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
most men of science&mdash;naturally, seeing that they
used gifts of imagination differing from those of
the poet only in being disciplined and chastened,
and ready to submit to the thraldom of the
established fact. Sometimes, indeed, the vein of
poetry has interfered with business, as in the case
of the ingenious Scheuchzer, who laid himself out
to prove that there were dragons in the Alps, or,
in a less degree, in the case of Buffon. But,
whether it interferes with business or not, there
the vein of poetry almost always is. Such old men
of science as Conrad Gesner, and such modern men
of science as Huxley and Tyndall, have shown us
with what striking effect it can be worked. It is
because de Saussure worked it so well that his
writings still live, though, regarded merely as textbooks,
they have long since been superseded.</p>

<p>The humanity of the man is continually flashing
out at us in the reflections and anecdotes with
which he illustrates the manners of the strange
peoples in the strange places which he visited.
Sometimes it is a flash of humour, as when he
inquires the motives that impel men to be chamois-hunters,
a trade that never pays. ‘It is the
dangers,’ he concludes; ‘the constant alternation
of hopes and fears, the continual emotion thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
engendered, which excite the hunter, just as they
excite the gambler, the soldier, the navigator, and
even, to a certain extent, the naturalist of the
Alps.’</p>

<p>Sometimes it is a touch of pathos, as in the story
of the old woman of Argentière whose father,
husband, and brothers had all perished, within a
few days, from an epidemic:</p>

<p>‘After she had given me some milk, she asked
me where I came from, and what I was doing there
at that season of the year. When she knew that I
was from Geneva, she told me that she could not
believe that all the Protestants were to be damned;
that God was too good and too just to condemn us
all without distinction. Then, after reflecting for
a moment, she shook her head and added: “But
what is so strange to me is that of all those who
have been taken away from us, not one has ever
come back. I,” she went on, with a look of pain
“have wept so for my husband and my brothers,
and have never ceased to think of them, and every
night I implore them to tell me where they are, and
whether they are happy. Surely, if they existed
anywhere, they would not leave me in this doubt.
But perhaps,” she went on, “it is because I am not
worthy of this favour. Perhaps the pure and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
innocent souls of those children there”&mdash;she pointed
to the cradle as she spoke&mdash;“are conscious of their
presence, and enjoy a happiness that is denied
to me.”’</p>

<p>Truly a wonderful passage to find embedded in a
valuable and solid treatise on geology. Ramond
never surpassed it though he laid himself out to do
so, and&mdash;in his earlier works, at all events&mdash;never
allowed geological considerations to stand in the
way of sentiment.</p>

<p>It is sad to relate that, after having made himself
known to all Europe as ‘the illustrious
de Saussure,’ the pioneer of geological discovery fell
upon evil days. But so it was. His health broke
down; in 1794 he began to have paralytic strokes.
His fortune&mdash;the greater part of it, at all events&mdash;was
lost through the collapse of securities during
the French Revolution. He was on the side that
suffered most in the political disturbances which the
Revolution engendered at Geneva.</p>

<p>In the midst of those disturbances, his father-in-law,
Charles Bonnet, died, and de Saussure, himself
almost to be reckoned a dying man, was called
upon to pronounce his public eulogium. But the
disturbances made it necessary for the ceremony to
be postponed. A letter in which Madame de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Saussure narrates the incident gives us a clear
impression not only of the day, but also of the
times of which the day was representative.</p>

<p>‘Yesterday,’ she writes, ‘I spent one of those
days of emotion which do not affect us the less
because we ought to be getting used to them.
The people took up arms by order of the Committees
of the Clubs. The gates were shut, the
cannon rumbled along the streets, screaming
women leant out of their windows to look. In the
evening the town had that military air which you
have sometimes seen in it&mdash;the streets full of armed
citizens with flaming torches, patrols challenging
the passers-by&mdash;and all this lasted till two or three
in the morning; whereas to-day, everyone is at his
shop, his café, or his office. And this tumultuous
day had been selected for the celebration of the
memory of the most peaceable of citizens&mdash;your
uncle, Charles Bonnet.’</p>

<p>And so, amid such sorry scenes, the end
approached. De Saussure sought relief and health
in travel. He took the waters at Plombières, but
without any good result, and died early in 1799,
the great Cuvier pronouncing his eulogy before the
Institut de France.</p>

<span class="subhead">MEN OF LETTERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We have spoken of the literature of science. In
the literature which is an art, and an end in itself,
Geneva never excelled; and if we look for reasons,
we can find several.</p>

<p>The first difficulty was with the language.
French came to the Genevans as a foreign tongue
at a time when their men of learning wrote Latin
and their populace spoke a Savoyard patois; and,
even to the present day, few of them avoid a certain
provincial awkwardness in the handling of it. Anyone
who wishes to see the proof has only to
compare the <cite>Journal de Genève</cite> with the <cite>Gil
Blas</cite> or the <cite>Figaro</cite>. The few stylists whom
Geneva can claim have generally been of French
extraction, like Marc Monnier, or have lived abroad,
like Rousseau and Madame de Staël. A far more
typical Genevan writer was Charles Bonnet whose
perplexing circumlocutions swamp his elevated
sentiments and effectively prevent his books from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
being read. There is also, of course, Amiel; but
even ‘Roulez, tambours’ is tolerably obvious;
while the trail of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cliché</i> lies even over that
famous ‘Journal Intime’ which Mrs. Humphry
Ward translated.</p>

<p>Another difficulty was the vexatious censorship
exercised by Town Councillors, whose views of
literature were parochial. Even Agrippa d’Aubigné,
with all his fame and merit, was pursued
by their suspicions both during his lifetime and
after his death. The printer of one of his works
was imprisoned and fined for issuing from his press
a book alleged to contain ‘much impious and
blasphemous matter which scandalizes well-conducted
persons’; while, after his decease, his papers
were sent for, to be inspected by public officials.
‘Anything composed by the defunct,’ it was
decided, ‘during his residence in this State must
be suppressed, but anything composed on other
territory may be restored to his heirs.’ Literary
decorum may have been insured by such measures;
but they were not calculated to encourage originality,
and it is not surprising that we search
Genevan annals in vain for distinguished literary
names.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE STATUE OF JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU ON THE ISLAND IN THE RHONE, GENEVA, FROM HOTEL DES BERGUES</div></div>

<p>The name of which the Genevans are proudest is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
probably that of Rousseau, who has sometimes been
spoken of as ‘the austere citizen of Geneva.’ But
‘austere’ is a strange epithet to apply to the
philosopher who endowed the Foundling Hospital
with five illegitimate children; and Geneva cannot
claim a great share in a citizen who ran away from
the town in his boyhood to avoid being thrashed for
stealing apples. It was, indeed, at Geneva that
Jean Jacques received from his aunt the disciplinary
chastisement of which he gives such an exciting
account in his ‘Confessions’; and he once returned
to the city and received the Holy Communion
there in later life. But that is all. Jean Jacques
was not educated at Geneva, but in Savoy&mdash;at
Annecy, at Turin, and at Chambéry; his books
were not printed at Geneva, though one of them
was publicly burnt there, but in Paris and Amsterdam;
it is not to Genevan but to French literature
that he belongs. And when Jean Jacques has
been named, there remains no other Genevan
citizen of letters worthy to be mentioned in the
same paragraph. So that branch of the subject
may be left.</p>

<span class="subhead">SONGS AND SQUIBS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Perhaps it is in song and satire that Geneva has
done best. ‘Roulez, tambours,’ is not the only
Genevan song that has passed the Genevan frontier;
and Geneva, in fact, has always been ready to burst
into song, whether serious or sarcastic, in connection
with the topics of the day. The Reformation
itself was heralded by satirical verses. A species
of burlesque entitled a ‘sottie’ was, in those days,
a favourite form of entertainment. The general
character of these compositions may be gathered
from the following scrap of dialogue, contained
in one of them, between the <em>Physician</em> and the
<em>World</em>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span></p><div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">‘<em>Physician.</em> So that is what upsets your mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you are not upset to find<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or babies on their mothers’ knee<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><em>Physician.</em> Whatever the abuse you ban,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call you, now, a Lutheran.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The flood-gates of poetry were opened afresh by
the failure of the Escalade. Even the octogenarian
M. de Bèze composed a song on that occasion:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">‘Peuple Genevois,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Et la délivrance<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Que vit avant-hier!’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Other poets followed the pastor’s example by
the score. For years&mdash;for decades even&mdash;they
mocked in verse at the enemy whom they had put
to shame. When, at last, they were silent, the
revolutionary movement of the eighteenth century
produced its harvest of squibs; and then we come
to the Restoration, and the religious revival known
as the Réveil, which also produced considerable
literary repercussions.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="subhead">RELIGIOUS REVIVAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>‘Réveil’ is Swiss for Revivalism. The movement
was the Genevan analogue of our Wesleyan
Methodism, though it did not begin till more than
five-and-twenty years after John Wesley’s death.
The originator of it was the Scotch evangelist,
Robert Haldane. He came to Geneva, made the
acquaintance of the theological students, and was
surprised and shocked.</p>

<p>‘Had they been trained,’ he writes, ‘in the
schools of Socrates or Plato, and enjoyed no other
means of instruction, they could scarcely have
been more ignorant of the doctrines of the Gospel.
To the Bible and its contents their studies had
never been directed. After some conversation,
they became convinced of their ignorance of the
Scriptures, and of the way of salvation, and exceedingly
desirous of information.’</p>

<p>The young men fell into a habit of dropping in
upon Mr. Haldane, at all hours of the day and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
night, to talk over the mysteries of revealed
religion. He decided to organize his efforts for
their evangelization, take them in classes three
nights a week, and expound the Epistle to the
Romans. His influence over them was the more
remarkable because he was, at first, obliged to
converse with them by means of an interpreter.
And he had remarkable men among his pupils:
Adolphe Monod, of Paris; Félix Neff, the Alpine
missionary; and Merle d’Aubigné, the historian of
the Reformation. A friend, too old to be his
pupil, and already of his way of thinking, was
Cæsar Malan, the hymnodist.</p>

<div id="ip_96" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_169.jpg" width="600" height="357" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE HEAD OF LAKE ANNECY HTE. SAVOIE</div></div>

<p>The movement thus inaugurated was, it may be
presumed, neither wholly good nor wholly bad.
No doubt it was well for the old-fashioned Calvinists
to be shaken out of their old-fashioned
formalism, and taught to regard religion, not as
the placid and docile acceptance of a theological
code, but as the special experience of the individual
soul. The history of religion is the history of such
reactions against formalism; and, on the whole,
they make for progress. But revivalists, being
only human after all, have, like other people, their
besetting sins. They are prone to hypocrisy, to
spiritual pride, to sour austerity, to the passing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
uncharitable judgments on their neighbours, and
to the unwarranted assumption of the right to cast
the first stone at sinners.</p>

<p>These vices of the revivalists attracted the attention
of that section of young Geneva which was
not absorbed in the contemplation of their virtues.
They disliked to see them stand at the corners of
the market-place and, for a pretence, make long
prayers. They took the same line towards them
as was taken towards Calvin and Farel by those
earlier Friends of Liberty who demanded permission
to ‘live as they chose without reference to
what was said by the preachers’; and they chiefly
expressed themselves in verse. They formed a
club&mdash;the Caveau Genevois; and though the waters
of oblivion have swept over most of their writings,
they were the choice spirits of the Geneva of their
time, and one of them has left us a graphic word-picture
of their meetings:</p>

<p>‘Our gathering, to which every member was
expected to contribute a new song or a new air,
took place irregularly, and in various places.
Sometimes we met on the beautiful banks of our
lake, at Cologny, on the terrace of the Hotel du
Lion d’Or. We used to come home arm-in-arm,
larking and singing, good friends and jolly fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
ready to begin again those charming scenes which
politics never troubled, and in which music, poetry,
and joy&mdash;those crowns of harmony and loyal friendship&mdash;reigned
alone.’</p>

<p>And one at least of their songs still lives&mdash;the
song written by J.&nbsp;F. Chaponnière, which opens
thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">

<span class="subhead">ROMANTICISM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>About 1830 the Caveau Genevois broke up. Some
of its members were dead, some had left Geneva,
some were growing too old for poetry, and some were
going in for politics. But as the old school faded
away, a new school&mdash;the Romantic School&mdash;was
dawning. Poets arose who acknowledged Lamartine
for their father and Victor Hugo for their
elder brother. They are not really important, but
Marc Monnier, in ‘Genève et ses Poètes,’ has
made them intensely interesting. The greatest
poet among them was Etienne Gide, Professor of
Law at the University. Most students of French
poetry have by heart that song of his which
runs:</p>

<p>Another notable man&mdash;more notable as a man
than a poet&mdash;was Petit-Senn, who lived to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
patriarchal age and was a member of all the literary
groups in succession. He is sometimes spoken of
as a Genevan Voltaire; and he resembled Voltaire
in living a little way out of the town, yet in touch
with its intellectual life, and receiving the homage
of a constant stream of admiring pilgrims; but he
is even better entitled to be styled the Genevan
Mæcænas. Possessed of something more than a
modest competence, he opened his purse freely to
the poorer poets, not only relieving their necessities,
but paying for the publication of their works. His
‘Miliciade’&mdash;a satire on the amateurishness of the
Genevan army&mdash;had an immense success when he
gave a reading of it in a concert-hall; and his
‘Bluettes et Boutades’ are short sentences generally
worthy of being ranked with epigrams. We may
cull a few of them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘In the eyes of the world, however one may have made
one’s money, one has done better than if one had lost it.</p>

<p>‘The egoist weeps over the story of a shipwreck at the
reflection that he might himself have been on board.</p>

<p>‘We are more ready to do justice to the dead than to the
absent.</p>

<p>‘Some of the sins of youth are so agreeable that age repents
of them only in order to have an excuse for recalling them.</p>

<p>‘When a friend asks you for money, consider which of the
two you would rather lose.</p>

<p>‘The most lucrative kind of commerce would be to buy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
men at their real value, and sell them at their own valuation.</p>

<p>‘If hypocrisy were to die, modesty would, at least, have to
go into half-mourning.</p>

<p>‘Let us respect white hairs ... especially our own.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Petit-Senn and Etienne Gide were the poets who
remained in their city. It is characteristic of
Genevan literary history that the others sought
their fortune abroad. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Trop grand poisson pour
notre petit lac</i> was presumably their motto, though
they were not fish who cut any very striking figure
in the lakes to which they repaired. Charles Didier
was the one of them who succeeded best. He took
long walking tours in Italy, glorified the carbonari,
pictured the meetings of their secret societies in the
style of ‘The Mysteries of Udolpho,’ and ultimately
acquired something of a literary position in Paris,
where he was numbered among the friends of
George Sand. Imbert Galloix also went to Paris,
but fell into destitution there. Nodier helped him.
‘I send you,’ he wrote, ‘the half of what I have in
the house. It is the first time that I blush for my
poverty.’ Petit-Senn also sent him money, for
which he appealed in a very pathetic letter; but he
died&mdash;a pitiful figure, reminding one of Chatterton&mdash;at
the age of twenty-one. Others of the company
were Henri Blanvalet, who for twenty years was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
private tutor to the Frankfort Rothschilds&mdash;truly
a sorry position for a poet; and André Verre, who
went to Russia to teach in a girls’ school, and
ultimately edited a newspaper in Buenos Ayres.
None of them count. They were merely echoes of
the louder voices heard in the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cénacle</i>.</p>

<p>One would be tempted, if space permitted, to
say something of the later literary luminaries of
Geneva: of Amiel, the ‘virtuous Don Juan,’ as
his friends called him, who, after living rather a
futile life, acquired posthumous fame through his
‘Journal’; of Cherbuliez, the novelist, once very
popular, though now somewhat out of fashion; of
Marc Monnier, the sparkling and versatile father of
Dr. Philippe Monnier who has inherited his wit; of
Toepfer, author of ‘Nouvelles Genevoises,’ described
by one critic as ‘a sort of Swiss Ally Sloper,’ and
by another as ‘a sort of Swiss Max O’Rell, with
just a dash of Mr. Barlow’; of Emile Javelle, who
climbed the Alps diligently and wrote of them
poetically; of MM. Eugène Ritter and Albert de
Montet, the pillars of historical research in French
Switzerland. But space does not permit. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
little space remains is claimed by certain distinguished
strangers who have shed lustre upon
Geneva by living in the neighbourhood. We

<span class="subhead">VOLTAIRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Voltaire was sixty years of age when he settled
on the shores of the lake, where he was to remain
for another four-and-twenty years; and he did not
go there for his pleasure. He would have preferred
to live in Paris, but was afraid of being locked up
in the Bastille. As the great majority of the men
of letters of the reign of Louis XV. were, at one
time or another, locked up in the Bastille, his fears
were probably well founded. Moreover, notes of
warning had reached his ears. ‘I dare not ask you
to dine,’ a relative said to him, ‘because you are in
bad odour at Court.’ So he betook himself to
Geneva, as so many Frenchmen, illustrious and
otherwise, had done before, and acquired various
properties&mdash;at Prangins, at Lausanne, at Saint-Jean
(near Geneva), at Ferney, at Tournay, and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>He was welcomed cordially. Dr. Tronchin, the
eminent physician, co-operated in the legal fictions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
necessary to enable him to become a landowner in
the republic. Cramer, the publisher, made a
proposal for the issue of a complete and authorized
edition of his works. All the best people called.
‘It is very pleasant,’ he was able to write, ‘to live
in a country where rulers borrow your carriage to
come to dinner with you.’ Yet his desire to ‘score
off’ the ministers of religion, who no doubt struck
him as pretentious persons of sluggish intellect,
soon set him at loggerheads with his hosts.</p>

<p>The first trouble arose in connection with the
article on Geneva published in the encyclopædia
edited by Diderot and d’Alembert. It was in the
course of a short visit to Voltaire that d’Alembert
gathered the materials for that article. He was
encouraged, and afforded every facility for pursuing
his researches, alike by the ministers and by the
magistrates. ‘He is the curiosity of the town,’ a
contemporary letter-writer declared, ‘and it is quite
the fashion to go and call on him.’ In particular
he was entertained by the clergy, and talked
theology with them after dinner. Their views
were broad, thanks to the influence of that eminent
theologian, Turretini; probably their views were
broader after dinner than before. At all events,
the encyclopædist drew them out to his satisfaction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
with the result that, when his article appeared,
and the divines made haste to read it, it was found
that their theological position was expounded in
the following startling paragraph:</p>

<p>‘There is less complaint of the advance of infidelity
at Geneva than elsewhere; but that is not
surprising. Religion there&mdash;unless it be among
the common people&mdash;is reduced to the worship of
one God; a certain respect for Jesus Christ and
the Scriptures is, perhaps, the only thing that
distinguishes the Christianity of Geneva from pure
Deism.’</p>

<p>This in the city of Calvin. It was as though
the encyclopædist had stirred a hornets’ nest. To
change the metaphor, the fat was in the fire, and
the flame blazed up at once. The Consistory met
and appointed a Commission ‘to consider what
were the best steps to take in the matter.’ The
Commission deputed Dr. Tronchin to try and
obtain an apology and retraction from the offending
author; and Dr. Tronchin applied to Voltaire for
help. Seeing that Voltaire had already written to
d’Alembert congratulating him on his success in
arousing the ‘murmurs of the synagogue,’ this was
not a very hopeful step. Voltaire, in fact, had
inspired the statements which he was now asked to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
invite his collaborator to withdraw. He temporized,
enjoyed the fun, and tampered with the truth, to
keep it up. He protested that he knew nothing
about the article; that he wanted nothing but a
quiet life, for himself and for everybody else, including
‘Trinitarians, Unitarians, Quakers, Moravians,
Turks, Jews, and Chinamen.’ He also, in the
friendliest manner, warned his correspondent that,
if d’Alembert were pressed too hard, he might,
instead of apologizing, prove that the things which
he had said were true.</p>

<p>‘Retractation,’ he wrote, ‘was all very well for
St. Augustine; but it will not do for him. I know
his character. If your complaints get too loud, he
will quote a certain catechism by your Professor of
Theology, wherein it is said that revelation is “a
thing of some utility,” and wherein there is no
single word about the holy, adorable, and invisible
Trinity. When he establishes that he has not
disclosed a secret, but has only publicly taken
cognizance of an opinion publicly expressed, you
will be slightly embarrassed.’</p>

<span class="subhead">VOLTAIRE AND THE THEATRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Another bone of contention was found in Voltaire’s
passionate devotion to the theatre. His tastes were
shared by the ‘advanced’ set at Geneva; but the
divines, in spite of their broad views on matters of
dogmatic theology, still held narrow views on the
subject of the drama. Dramatic performances,
whether public or private, were not allowed upon
Genevan soil; while performances given close
to the frontier, on the territory of Savoy or
France, caused the ministers many searchings of
heart.</p>

<p>There had been such performances shortly before
Voltaire’s arrival&mdash;in 1751&mdash;at Carouge and Chatelaine,
and the Consistory had passed a resolution on
the subject. It had decided to exhort the members
of the Council to keep their wives away from the
entertainments, and to exhort the professors to
warn the students&mdash;and more particularly the
candidates for Holy Orders&mdash;not to attend them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Afterwards, hearing that the daughters of some of
the pastors had visited the theatre in defiance of
their admonitions, they had passed a further resolution
to the effect that this state of things gave
ground for reflection&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qu’il y a lieu d’y réfléchir</i>.</p>

<p>Such was the public opinion which Voltaire
braved; and his first attempt to brave it was not
very successful. Soon after his arrival he arranged
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salle de spectacle</i> inside the city walls, and
organized a performance of ‘L’Orphelin de la Chine.’
The Consistory growled out a hostile resolution, and
he dropped the enterprise, but proceeded to
educate opinion from a safe distance; that is to
say, he set up his theatre at Lausanne, and wrote
insinuating letters about its management to his
friends among the Genevan pastors. We have
Gibbon’s testimony to the fact that this theatre
‘refined in a visible degree the manners of
Lausanne’; and we have a letter in which Voltaire
gives the pastor, Vernés, sound reasons for coming
to witness the performances.</p>

<p>‘In your quality of minister of the Gospel,’ he
writes, ‘you might very well be present at the
rendering of a piece taken from the Gospel itself,
and hear the word of God from the mouth of the
Marquise de Gentil, Madame d’Aubonne, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Madame d’Hermenches, who are as worthy women
as the three Magdalens, and more respectable.’
And he adds: ‘At the first representation we had
all the ministers of the Holy Gospel in the Town,
and all the candidates for Holy Orders.’</p>

<p>It was a pretty good beginning; but there was
still to be trouble and controversy before the
educational process was completed. In this field,
as in the field of theology, d’Alembert, with his
encyclopædia article, stirred Camerina. He said
that it was a pity that comedy should be neglected
in such a centre of civilization, but added that the
thing that the Genevans dreaded was not the
demoralizing influence of plays, but the dissolute
behaviour of players. And he suggested that this
difficulty be got over by means of stringent regulations
as to the conduct of comedians. By this
means, he said, Geneva might have both good
morals and good theatres, and derive as much
advantage from the one as from the other.</p>

<p>For the moment it looked as though this ingeniously
ironical proposal would escape attention,
the theologians being too excited about their
impugned orthodoxy to notice anything else.
Rousseau, however, saw it, and decided to reply to
it, and in due course launched his ‘Lettre sur les<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Spectacles.’ Being himself a dramatic author of
some note, he was not an ideal champion of the
cause which he represented; but in the stir caused
by his intervention no one seems to have thought
of that. His rhetoric made just as lively an
impression as though his actions had always been
in keeping with it. The Genevans took sides; and
Voltaire&mdash;as though for the express purpose of
giving them something tangible to fight about&mdash;established
a theatre close to their gates, outside
the jurisdiction of their magistrates, at Tournay.</p>

<p>The battle raged furiously. To this period of
Voltaire’s sojourn belong most of his bitter sarcastic
sayings about Geneva; his reference to ‘the little
church of Calvin, which makes virtue consist in
usury and asceticism,’ and his famous epigram
containing the lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">‘On haït le bal, on haït la comédie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour tout plaisir Genève psalmodie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Du bon David des antiques concerts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Croyant que Dieu se plaît aux mauvais vers.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Abuse of Jean Jacques also abounds in his letters
at this period. Jean Jacques is a ‘blackguard’;
Jean Jacques is in league with two rascally
Calvinist priests, and ‘has the insolence’ to say
this, that, and the other thing; Jean Jacques is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
‘valet to Diogenes,’ who ‘has played in vain the
part of an addle-pated idiot’; if Jean Jacques comes
to Ferney, he shall be stuffed into a barrel, and
presumably rolled downhill&mdash;which proves, even if
it proves nothing else, that, when philosophers fall
out, they are apt to wrangle in much the same
language as less intellectual people.</p>

<p>Yet, on the whole, Voltaire was steadily winning
the victory. The Council, it is true, forbade the
citizens to attend his theatre; but little attention
was paid to the prohibition, and among those who
disregarded it were included many of the Councillors
themselves. ‘Being unable,’ as Petit-Senn
wittily put it, ‘to remove the danger, they bravely
set out to share it’; and the philosopher chuckled:</p>

<p>‘I am civilizing the Allobroges as well as I can.
Before I came here the Genevans had nothing to
amuse them but bad sermons. I am corrupting
all the youth of the pedantic city. I make play-actors
of the sons of Syndics. The clergy are
furious; but I crush them.’</p>

<p>After a while, moreover, his evangelistic efforts
received support from an unexpected quarter. In
1766 there were certain political disturbances in
the city, and ambassadors were sent from Berne,
Zurich, and Paris, to assist in composing them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Voltaire suggested to the French ambassador,
M. de Beauteville, that he should request admission
to the city for a company of comedians to amuse
himself and his suite. Life at Geneva being duller
than he liked, M. de Beauteville adopted the
suggestion. The comedians were introduced; a
theatre was arranged for them; and Voltaire could
chuckle again. The divines thundered. ‘Children,’
they declared, ‘will be badly brought up; domestic
discords will trouble families more and more;
young men and young women will occupy themselves
with nothing but comedy and vainglorious
display; the love of pleasure, vanity, and pride
will be their favourite emotions; indecent familiarities
and libertine behaviour will take the place of
modesty and chastity.’</p>

<p>But this warning was uttered in vain. Voltaire
had triumphed; and though he was now an old
man, nearing his eightieth birthday, he enjoyed his
triumph to the full. A picture of the patriarch at
the play is graphically drawn by a letter-writer of
the period:</p>

<p>‘Not the least interesting feature of the spectacle
was Voltaire himself, leaning his back against the
wings in full view of the audience, applauding like
a man possessed; now beating the floor with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
walking-stick, now interjecting exclamations such
as “Couldn’t be better!” “By God, how good!”
and now directing the flow of sentiment by lifting
his handkerchief to his eyes. So little could he
control his enthusiasm that, at the moment when
Ninias quits the scene to brave Assue, he ran after
Lekain without considering how he was breaking
down the illusion, took him by the hand, and kissed
him at the back of the stage. It would be difficult
to imagine a more ridiculous burlesque; for Voltaire
looked like an old man out of a farce, dressed in a
bygone fashion, with his stockings rolled up over
his knees, and only able to keep himself on his
trembling legs with the help of his stick.’</p>

<span class="subhead">VISITORS TO FERNEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While Voltaire was vexing the citizens of Geneva,
he was also enjoying the veneration of all educated
Europe, and even of educated America. He
corresponded regularly with at least four reigning
sovereigns, to say nothing of men of letters,
Cardinals, and Marshals of France; and he kept
open house for travellers of mark from every
country in the world. Those of the travellers who
wrote books never failed to devote a chapter to an
account of a visit to Ferney; and from the mass
of such descriptions we may select for quotation
that written, in the stately style of the period, by
Dr. John Moore, author of ‘Zeluco,’ then making
the grand tour as tutor to the Duke of Hamilton.</p>

<p>‘The most piercing eyes I ever beheld,’ the
doctor writes, ‘are those of Voltaire, now in his
eightieth year. His whole countenance is expressive
of genius, observation, and extreme sensibility. In
the morning he has a look of anxiety and discontent;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
but this gradually wears off, and after dinner
he seems cheerful; yet an air of irony never
entirely forsakes his face, but may always be
observed lurking in his features whether he frowns
or smiles.... Composition is his principal
amusement. No author who writes for daily bread,
no young poet ardent for distinction, is more
assiduous with his pen, or more anxious for fresh
fame, than the wealthy and applauded Seigneur of
Ferney. He lives in a very hospitable manner,
and takes care always to have a good cook. He
generally has two or three visitors from Paris, who
stay with him a month or six weeks at a time.
When they go, their places are soon supplied, so
that there is a constant rotation of society at
Ferney. These, with Voltaire’s own family and
his visitors from Geneva, compose a company of
twelve or fourteen people, who dine daily at his
table, whether he appears or not.... All who
bring recommendations from his friends may depend
upon being received, if he be not really indisposed.
He often presents himself to the strangers who
assemble every afternoon in his antechamber,
although they bring no particular recommendation.’</p>

  <div class="caption">A VAUDOISE: SUMMER</div></div>

<p>It might have been added that, when an interesting
stranger who carried no introduction was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
passing through the town, Voltaire sometimes
sent for him; but this experiment was not
always a success, and failed most ludicrously in
the case of Claude Gay, the Philadelphian Quaker,
author of some theological works now forgotten,
but then of note. The meeting was only arranged
with difficulty on the philosopher’s undertaking
to put a bridle on his tongue, and say nothing
flippant about holy things. He tried to keep his
promise, but the temptation was too strong for
him. After a while he entangled his guest in a
controversy concerning the proceedings of the
patriarchs and the evidences of Christianity, and
lost his temper on finding that his sarcasms failed
to make their usual impression. The member of
the Society of Friends, however, was not disconcerted.
He rose from his place at the dinner-table,
and replied:</p>

<p>‘Friend Voltaire! perhaps thou mayest come to
understand these matters rightly; in the meantime,
finding I can do thee no good, I leave thee, and so
fare thee well.’</p>

<p>And so saying, he walked out and walked back
to Geneva, while Voltaire retired in dudgeon to
his room, and the company sat expecting something
terrible to happen.</p>

<span class="subhead">COPPETT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A word, in conclusion, about Coppet!</p>

<p>Necker bought the property from his old banking
partner, Thelusson, for 500,000 livres in French
money, and retired to live there when the French
Revolution drove him out of politics. His daughter,
Madame de Staël, inherited it from him, and made
it famous.</p>

<p>Not that she loved Switzerland; it would be
more true to say that she detested Switzerland.
Swiss scenery meant nothing to her. When she
was taken for an excursion to the glaciers, she asked
what the crime was that she had to expiate by such
a punishment; and she could look out on the blue
waters of Lake Leman, and sigh for ‘the gutter of
the Rue du Bac.’ Even to this day, the Swiss
have hardly forgiven her for that, or for speaking
of the Canton of Vaud as the country in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
she had been ‘so intensely bored for such a number
of years.’</p>

<p>What she wanted was to live in Paris, to be a
leader&mdash;or, rather, to be <em>the</em> leader&mdash;of Parisian
society, to sit in a salon, the admired of all
admirers, and to pull the wires of politics to the
advantage of her friends. For a while she
succeeded in doing this. It was she who persuaded
Barras to give Talleyrand his political start in life.
But whereas Barras was willing to act on her
advice, Napoleon was by no means equally
amenable to her influence. Almost from the first
he regarded her as a mischief-maker; and when a
spy brought him an intercepted letter in which
Madame de Staël expressed her hope that none of
the old aristocracy of France would condescend to
accept appointments in the household of ‘the
bourgeois of Corsica,’ he became her personal
enemy, and, refusing her permission to live either
in the capital or near it, practically compelled her
to take refuge in her country seat. Her pleasaunce
in that way became her gilded cage.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was not quite so unhappy there as
she sometimes represented. If she could not go to
Paris, many distinguished and brilliant Parisians
came to Coppet, and met there many brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
and distinguished Germans, Genevans, Italians,
and Danes. The Parisian salon, reconstituted,
flourished on Swiss soil. There visited there, at one
time or another, Madame Récamier and Madame
Krüdner; Benjamin Constant, who was so long
Madame de Staël’s lover; Bonstetten, the Voltairean
philosopher; Frederika Brun, the Danish artist;
Sismondi, the historian; Werner, the German poet;
Karl Ritter, the German geographer; Baron de
Voght; Monti, the Italian poet; Madame Vigée Le
Brun; Cuvier; and Oelenschlaeger. From almost
every one of them we have some pen-and-ink sketch
of the life there.</p>

<p>This, for instance, is the scene as it appeared to
Madame Le Brun, who came to paint the hostess’s
portrait:</p>

<p>‘I paint her in antique costume. She is not
beautiful, but the animation of her visage takes the
place of beauty. To aid the expression I wished
to give her, I entreated her to recite tragic verses
while I painted. She declaimed passages from
Corneille and Racine.... I find many persons
established at Coppet: the beautiful Madame
Récamier, the Comte de Sabran, a young English
woman, Benjamin Constant, etc. Its society is
continually renewed. They come to visit the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
illustrious exile who is pursued by the rancour of
the Emperor. Her two sons are now with her,
under the instruction of the German scholar
Schlegel; her daughter is very beautiful, and has a
passionate love of study; she leaves her company
free all the morning, but they unite in the evening.
It is only after dinner that they can converse with
her. She then walks in her salon, holding in her
hand a little green branch; and her words have an
ardour quite peculiar to her: it is impossible to
interrupt her. At these times she produces on one
the effect of an improvisatrice.’</p>

<p>And here is a still more graphic description,
taken from a letter written to Madame Récamier
by Baron de Voght:</p>

<p>‘It is to you that I owe my most amiable
reception at Coppet. It is no doubt to the favourable
expectations aroused by your friendship that I
owe my intimate acquaintance with this remarkable
woman. I might have met her without your
assistance&mdash;some casual acquaintance would no
doubt have introduced me&mdash;but I should never
have penetrated to the intimacy of this sublime and
beautiful soul, and should never have known how
much better she is than her reputation. <em>She is an
angel sent from heaven to reveal the divine goodness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
upon earth.</em> To make her irresistible, a pure ray of
celestial light embellishes her spirit and makes her
amiable from every point of view.</p>

<p>‘At once profound and light, whether she is
discovering a mysterious secret of the soul or
grasping the lightest shadow of a sentiment, her
genius shines without dazzling, and when the orb of
light has disappeared, it leaves a pleasant twilight to
follow it.... No doubt a few faults, a few
weaknesses, occasionally veil this celestial apparition;
even the initiated must sometimes be
troubled by these eclipses, which the Genevan
astronomers in vain endeavour to predict.</p>

<p>‘My travels so far have been limited to journeys
to Lausanne and Coppet, where I often stay three
or four days. The life there suits me perfectly;
the company is even more to my taste. I like
Constant’s wit, Schlegel’s learning, Sabran’s amiability,
Sismondi’s talent and character, the simple
truthful disposition and just intellectual perceptions
of Auguste,<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> the wit and sweetness of Albertine<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a>&mdash;I
was forgetting Bonstetten, an excellent fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
full of knowledge of all sorts, ready in wit,
adaptable in character&mdash;in every way inspiring
one’s respect and confidence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> Madame de Staël’s son, who afterwards edited the works
of Madame de Staël and Madame Necker.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> Madame de Staël’s daughter, afterwards Duchesse de
Broglie.</p></div>

<p>‘Your sublime friend looks and gives life to
everything. She imparts intelligence to those
around her. In every corner of the house some
one is engaged in composing a great work....
Corinne is writing her delightful letters about
Germany, which will no doubt prove to be the best
thing she has ever done.</p>

<p>‘The “Shunamitish Widow,” an Oriental melodrama
which she has just finished, will be played
in October; it is charming. Coppet will be flooded
with tears. Constant and Auguste are both composing
tragedies; Sabran is writing a comic
opera, and Sismondi a history; Schlegel is translating
something; Bonstetten is busy with
philosophy, and I am busy with my letter to
Juliette.’</p>

<p>Then, a month later:</p>

<p>‘Since my last letter, Madame de Staël has
read us several chapters of her work. Everywhere
it bears the marks of her talent. I wish
I could persuade her to cut out everything in
it connected with politics, and all the metaphors
which interfere with its clarity, simplicity and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
accuracy. What she needs to demonstrate is not
her republicanism, but her wisdom.... Mlle.
Jenner played in one of Werner’s tragedies
which was given, last Friday, before an audience
of twenty. She, Werner, and Schlegel played
perfectly....</p>

<p>‘The arrival in Switzerland of M. Cuvier has
been a happy distraction for Madame de Staël;
they spent two days together at Geneva, and were
well pleased with each other. On her return to
Coppet she found Middleton there, and in receiving
his confidences forgot her troubles. Yesterday she
resumed her work.</p>

<p>‘The poet whose mystical and sombre genius has
caused us such profound emotions starts, in a few
days’ time, for Italy.</p>

<p>‘I accompanied Corinne to Massot’s. To
alleviate the tedium of the sitting, a Mlle.
Romilly played pleasantly on the harp, and the
studio was a veritable temple of the Muses....</p>

<p>‘Bonstetten gave us two readings of a Memoir
on the Northern Alps. It began very well, but
afterwards it bored us.... Madame de Staël
resumed her reading, and there was no longer any
question of being bored. It is marvellous how
much she must have read and thought over to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
able to find the opportunity of saying so many good
things. One may differ from her, but one cannot
help delighting in her talent....</p>

<p>‘And now here we are at Geneva, trying to
reproduce Coppet at the Hôtel des Balances. I
am delightfully situated with a wide view over the
Valley of Savoy, between the Alps and the Jura....
Yesterday evening the illusion of Coppet was complete.
I had been with Madame de Staël to call
on Madame Rilliet, who is so charming at her own
fireside. On my return I played chess with
Sismondi. Madame de Staël, Mlle. Randall,
and Mlle. Jenner sat on the sofa chatting with
Bonstetten and young Barante. We were as we
had always been&mdash;as we were in the days that I
shall never cease regretting.’</p>

<p>Other descriptions exist in great abundance, but
these suffice to serve our purpose. They show us
the Coppet salon as it was&mdash;pleasant, brilliant,
unconventional; something like Holland House,
but more Bohemian; something like Harley
Street, but more select; something like Gad’s
Hill&mdash;which it resembled in the fact that the
members of the house-parties were expected to
spend their mornings at their desks&mdash;but on a
higher social plane; a centre at once of high thinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
and frivolous behaviour; of hard work and
desperate love-making, which sometimes paved the
way to trouble.</p>

<p>If only one had space to go into the details of
that love-making! But that is a subject which
would need a much larger book than this to do it
justice.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
